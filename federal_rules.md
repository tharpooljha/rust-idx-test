# HISTORICAL NOTE

The Supreme Court prescribes rules of civil procedure for the district courts pursuant to section 2072 of Title 28, United States Code, as enacted by Title IV ‘‘Rules Enabling Act’’ of Pub. L. 100–702 (approved November 19, 1988, 102 Stat. 4648), effective De- cember 1, 1988. Pursuant to section 2074 of Title 28, the Supreme Court transmits to Congress (not later than May 1 of the year in which a rule prescribed under section 2072 is to become effective) a copy of the proposed rule. The rule takes effect no earlier than December 1 of the year in which the rule is transmitted unless otherwise provided by law.

By act of June 19, 1934, ch. 651, 48 Stat. 1064 (subsequently 28 United States Code, § 2072), the Supreme Court was authorized to prescribe general rules of civil procedure for the district courts. The rules, and subsequent amendments, were not to take effect until (1) they had been first reported to Congress by the Attorney General at the beginning of a regular session and (2) after the close of that session.

Under a 1949 amendment to 28 U.S.C., § 2072, the Chief Justice of the United States, instead of the Attorney General, reported the rules to Congress. In 1950, section 2072 was further amended so that amendments to the rules could be reported to Congress not later than May 1 each year and become effective 90 days after being reported. Effective December 1, 1988, section 2072 was re- pealed and supplanted by new sections 2072 and 2074, see first para- graph of Historical Note above.

The original rules, pursuant to act of June 19, 1934, were adopted by order of the Court on December 20, 1937, transmitted to Con- gress by the Attorney General on January 3, 1938, and became ef- fective September 16, 1938 (308 U.S. 645; Cong. Rec., vol. 83, pt. 1, p. 13, Exec. Comm. 905; H. Doc. 460 and H. Doc. 588, 75th Cong.)

Rule 81(a)(6) was abrogated by order of the Court on December 28, 1939, transmitted to Congress by the Attorney General on Jan- uary 3, 1940, effective April 3, 1941 (308 U.S. 642; Cong. Rec., vol. 86, pt. 1, p. 14, Exec. Comm. 1152).

Effective September 16, 1938, as amended to December 1, 2022

# TITLE I. SCOPE OF RULES; FORM OF ACTION

# Rule 1. Scope and Purpose

These rules govern the procedure in all civil actions and pro- ceedings in the United States district courts, except as stated in Rule 81. They should be construed, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpen- sive determination of every action and proceeding.

# Rule 2. One Form of Action

There is one form of action—the civil action.

# TITLE II. COMMENCING AN ACTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS, PLEADINGS, MOTIONS, AND ORDERS

# Rule 3. Commencing an Action

A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the

# court.

# Rule 4. Summons

# (a) CONTENTS; AMENDMENTS.

# (1) Contents. A summons must:

(A) name the court and the parties; (B) be directed to the defendant; (C) state the name and address of the plaintiff’s attorney

or—if unrepresented—of the plaintiff;

(D) state the time within which the defendant must ap-

# pear and defend;

(E) notify the defendant that a failure to appear and de- fend will result in a default judgment against the defend- ant for the relief demanded in the complaint;

(F) be signed by the clerk; and (G) bear the court’s seal.

# 1 Title amended December 29, 1948, effective October 20, 1949.

# Rule 4

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(2) Amendments. The court may permit a summons to be

amended.

(b) ISSUANCE. On or after filing the complaint, the plaintiff may present a summons to the clerk for signature and seal. If the sum- mons is properly completed, the clerk must sign, seal, and issue it to the plaintiff for service on the defendant. A summons—or a copy of a summons that is addressed to multiple defendants—must be issued for each defendant to be served.

# (c) SERVICE.

(1) In General. A summons must be served with a copy of the complaint. The plaintiff is responsible for having the summons and complaint served within the time allowed by Rule 4(m) and must furnish the necessary copies to the person who makes service.

(2) By Whom. Any person who is at least 18 years old and not

a party may serve a summons and complaint.

(3) By a Marshal or Someone Specially Appointed. At the plain- tiff’s request, the court may order that service be made by a United States marshal or deputy marshal or by a person spe- cially appointed by the court. The court must so order if the plaintiff is authorized to proceed in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 or as a seaman under 28 U.S.C. § 1916.

# (d) WAIVING SERVICE.

(1) Requesting a Waiver. An individual, corporation, or asso- ciation that is subject to service under Rule 4(e), (f), or (h) has a duty to avoid unnecessary expenses of serving the summons. The plaintiff may notify such a defendant that an action has been commenced and request that the defendant waive service of a summons. The notice and request must: (A) be in writing and be addressed:

(i) to the individual defendant; or (ii) for a defendant subject to service under Rule 4(h), to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to re- ceive service of process;

(B) name the court where the complaint was filed; (C) be accompanied by a copy of the complaint, 2 copies of the waiver form appended to this Rule 4, and a prepaid means for returning the form;

(D) inform the defendant, using the form appended to this Rule 4, of the consequences of waiving and not waiv- ing service;

(E) state the date when the request is sent; (F) give the defendant a reasonable time of at least 30 days after the request was sent—or at least 60 days if sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States—to return the waiver; and

(G) be sent by first-class mail or other reliable means. (2) Failure to Waive. If a defendant located within the United States fails, without good cause, to sign and return a waiver requested by a plaintiff located within the United States, the court must impose on the defendant:

(A) the expenses later incurred in making service; and (B) the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, of

any motion required to collect those service expenses.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 4

(3) Time to Answer After a Waiver. A defendant who, before being served with process, timely returns a waiver need not serve an answer to the complaint until 60 days after the re- quest was sent—or until 90 days after it was sent to the de- fendant outside any judicial district of the United States.

(4) Results of Filing a Waiver. When the plaintiff files a waiv- er, proof of service is not required and these rules apply as if a summons and complaint had been served at the time of filing the waiver.

(5) Jurisdiction and Venue Not Waived. Waiving service of a summons does not waive any objection to personal jurisdic- tion or to venue.

(e) SERVING AN INDIVIDUAL WITHIN A JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF THE UNITED STATES. Unless federal law provides otherwise, an individ- ual—other than a minor, an incompetent person, or a person whose waiver has been filed—may be served in a judicial district of the United States by:

(1) following state law for serving a summons in an action brought in courts of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located or where service is made; or

(2) doing any of the following:

(A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the com-

# plaint to the individual personally;

(B) leaving a copy of each at the individual’s dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and dis- cretion who resides there; or

(C) delivering a copy of each to an agent authorized by

appointment or by law to receive service of process. (f) SERVING AN INDIVIDUAL IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. Unless federal law provides otherwise, an individual—other than a minor, an in- competent person, or a person whose waiver has been filed—may be served at a place not within any judicial district of the United States:

(1) by any internationally agreed means of service that is reasonably calculated to give notice, such as those authorized by the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents;

(2) if there is no internationally agreed means, or if an inter- national agreement allows but does not specify other means, by a method that is reasonably calculated to give notice:

(A) as prescribed by the foreign country’s law for service in that country in an action in its courts of general juris- diction;

# (B) as the foreign authority directs in response to a let-

# ter rogatory or letter of request; or

(C) unless prohibited by the foreign country’s law, by:

(i) delivering a copy of the summons and of the com-

# plaint to the individual personally; or

(ii) using any form of mail that the clerk addresses and sends to the individual and that requires a signed receipt; or

(3) by other means not prohibited by international agree-

# ment, as the court orders.

(g) SERVING A MINOR OR AN INCOMPETENT PERSON. A minor or an incompetent person in a judicial district of the United States

# Rule 4

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

A minor or an incompetent person who is not within any judicial district of the United States must be served in the manner pre- scribed by Rule 4(f)(2)(A), (f)(2)(B), or (f)(3).

(h) SERVING A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP, OR ASSOCIATION. Un- less federal law provides otherwise or the defendant’s waiver has been filed, a domestic or foreign corporation, or a partnership or other unincorporated association that is subject to suit under a common name, must be served:

# (1) in a judicial district of the United States:

(A) in the manner prescribed by Rule 4(e)(1) for serving

# an individual; or

(B) by delivering a copy of the summons and of the com- plaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to re- ceive service of process and—if the agent is one authorized by statute and the statute so requires—by also mailing a copy of each to the defendant; or

(2) at a place not within any judicial district of the United States, in any manner prescribed by Rule 4(f) for serving an individual, except personal delivery under (f)(2)(C)(i).

# (i) SERVING THE UNITED STATES AND ITS AGENCIES, CORPORA-

(1) United States. To serve the United States, a party must: (A)(i) deliver a copy of the summons and of the com- plaint to the United States attorney for the district where the action is brought—or to an assistant United States at- torney or clerical employee whom the United States attor- ney designates in a writing filed with the court clerk—or (ii) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the civil-process clerk at the United States attorney’s of- fice;

(B) send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the Attorney General of the United States at Washington, D.C.; and

(C) if the action challenges an order of a nonparty agen- cy or officer of the United States, send a copy of each by registered or certified mail to the agency or officer.

(2) Agency; Corporation; Officer or Employee Sued in an Official Capacity. To serve a United States agency or corporation, or a United States officer or employee sued only in an official ca- pacity, a party must serve the United States and also send a copy of the summons and of the complaint by registered or certified mail to the agency, corporation, officer, or employee. (3) Officer or Employee Sued Individually. To serve a United States officer or employee sued in an individual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties per- formed on the United States’ behalf (whether or not the officer or employee is also sued in an official capacity), a party must serve the United States and also serve the officer or employee under Rule 4(e), (f), or (g).

(4) Extending Time. The court must allow a party a reason-

able time to cure its failure to:

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 4

(A) serve a person required to be served under Rule 4(i)(2), if the party has served either the United States at- torney or the Attorney General of the United States; or

(B) serve the United States under Rule 4(i)(3), if the

party has served the United States officer or employee.

# (j) SERVING A FOREIGN, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

(1) Foreign State. A foreign state or its political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality must be served in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1608.

(2) State or Local Government. A state, a municipal corpora- tion, or any other state-created governmental organization that is subject to suit must be served by:

(A) delivering a copy of the summons and of the com-

# plaint to its chief executive officer; or

(B) serving a copy of each in the manner prescribed by that state’s law for serving a summons or like process on such a defendant.

# (k) TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE.

(1) In General. Serving a summons or filing a waiver of serv-

# ice establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant:

(A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of gen- eral jurisdiction in the state where the district court is lo- cated;

(B) who is a party joined under Rule 14 or 19 and is served within a judicial district of the United States and not more than 100 miles from where the summons was is- sued; or

(C) when authorized by a federal statute.

(2) Federal Claim Outside State-Court Jurisdiction. For a claim that arises under federal law, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a de- fendant if:

(A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any

# state’s courts of general jurisdiction; and

(B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United

# States Constitution and laws.

# (l) PROVING SERVICE.

(1) Affidavit Required. Unless service is waived, proof of serv- ice must be made to the court. Except for service by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, proof must be by the serv- er’s affidavit.

(2) Service Outside the United States. Service not within any judicial district of the United States must be proved as fol- lows:

(A) if made under Rule 4(f)(1), as provided in the applica-

# ble treaty or convention; or

(B) if made under Rule 4(f)(2) or (f)(3), by a receipt signed by the addressee, or by other evidence satisfying the court that the summons and complaint were delivered to the ad- dressee.

(3) Validity of Service; Amending Proof. Failure to prove serv- ice does not affect the validity of service. The court may per- mit proof of service to be amended.

(m) TIME LIMIT FOR SERVICE. If a defendant is not served within 90 days after the complaint is filed, the court—on motion or on its

# Rule 4

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

own after notice to the plaintiff—must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a specified time. But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court must extend the time for service for an ap- propriate period. This subdivision (m) does not apply to service in a foreign country under Rule 4(f), 4(h)(2), or 4(j)(1), or to service of a notice under Rule 71.1(d)(3)(A).

# (n) ASSERTING JURISDICTION OVER PROPERTY OR ASSETS.

(1) Federal Law. The court may assert jurisdiction over prop- erty if authorized by a federal statute. Notice to claimants of the property must be given as provided in the statute or by serving a summons under this rule.

(2) State Law. On a showing that personal jurisdiction over a defendant cannot be obtained in the district where the ac- tion is brought by reasonable efforts to serve a summons under this rule, the court may assert jurisdiction over the de- fendant’s assets found in the district. Jurisdiction is acquired by seizing the assets under the circumstances and in the man- ner provided by state law in that district.

# RULE 4 NOTICE OF A LAWSUIT AND REQUEST TO WAIVE SERVICE OF

(Caption) To (name the defendant or—if the defendant is a corporation, part- nership, or association—name an officer or agent authorized to receive service):

WHY ARE YOU GETTING THIS? A lawsuit has been filed against you, or the entity you rep- resent, in this court under the number shown above. A copy of the complaint is attached.

This is not a summons, or an official notice from the court. It is a request that, to avoid expenses, you waive formal service of a summons by signing and returning the enclosed waiver. To avoid these expenses, you must return the signed waiver within (give at least 30 days or at least 60 days if the defendant is outside any judicial district of the United States) from the date shown below, which is the date this notice was sent. Two copies of the waiver form are enclosed, along with a stamped, self-addressed envelope or other prepaid means for returning one copy. You may keep the other copy.

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? If you return the signed waiver, I will file it with the court. The action will then proceed as if you had been served on the date the waiver is filed, but no summons will be served on you and you will have 60 days from the date this notice is sent (see the date below) to answer the complaint (or 90 days if this notice is sent to you outside any judicial district of the United States).

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 4

If you do not return the signed waiver within the time indi- cated, I will arrange to have the summons and complaint served on you. And I will ask the court to require you, or the entity you represent, to pay the expenses of making service.

Please read the enclosed statement about the duty to avoid un-

# necessary expenses.

I certify that this request is being sent to you on the date below. Date:lllllllllll lllllllllllllllllllllllllll (Signature of the attorney or unrepresented party) lllllllllllllllllllllllllll (Printed name) lllllllllllllllllllllllllll (Address) lllllllllllllllllllllllllll (E-mail address) lllllllllllllllllllllllllll (Telephone number)

# (Caption)

To (name the plaintiff’s attorney or the unrepresented plaintiff): I have received your request to waive service of a summons in this action along with a copy of the complaint, two copies of this waiver form, and a prepaid means of returning one signed copy of the form to you.

I, or the entity I represent, agree to save the expense of serving

# a summons and complaint in this case.

I understand that I, or the entity I represent, will keep all de- fenses or objections to the lawsuit, the court’s jurisdiction, and the venue of the action, but that I waive any objections to the ab- sence of a summons or of service.

I also understand that I, or the entity I represent, must file and serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 within 60 days from lllllllllllllllllllll, the date when this re- quest was sent (or 90 days if it was sent outside the United States). If I fail to do so, a default judgment will be entered against me or the entity I represent.

# Rule 4.1

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(Attach the following)

# DUTY TO AVOID UNNECESSARY EXPENSES OF SERVING A SUMMONS

Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain defendants to cooperate in saving unnecessary expenses of serving a summons and complaint. A defendant who is located in the United States and who fails to return a signed waiver of service requested by a plaintiff located in the United States will be re- quired to pay the expenses of service, unless the defendant shows good cause for the failure.

‘‘Good cause’’ does not include a belief that the lawsuit is groundless, or that it has been brought in an improper venue, or that the court has no jurisdiction over this matter or over the de- fendant or the defendant’s property.

If the waiver is signed and returned, you can still make these and all other defenses and objections, but you cannot object to the absence of a summons or of service.

If you waive service, then you must, within the time specified on the waiver form, serve an answer or a motion under Rule 12 on the plaintiff and file a copy with the court. By signing and return- ing the waiver form, you are allowed more time to respond than if a summons had been served.

# Rule 4.1. Serving Other Process

(a) IN GENERAL. Process—other than a summons under Rule 4 or a subpoena under Rule 45—must be served by a United States mar- shal or deputy marshal or by a person specially appointed for that purpose. It may be served anywhere within the territorial limits of the state where the district court is located and, if authorized by a federal statute, beyond those limits. Proof of service must be made under Rule 4(l).

(b) ENFORCING ORDERS: COMMITTING FOR CIVIL CONTEMPT. An order committing a person for civil contempt of a decree or in- junction issued to enforce federal law may be served and enforced in any district. Any other order in a civil-contempt proceeding may be served only in the state where the issuing court is located or elsewhere in the United States within 100 miles from where the order was issued.

# Rule 5. Serving and Filing Pleadings and Other Papers

# (a) SERVICE: WHEN REQUIRED.

(1) In General. Unless these rules provide otherwise, each of

the following papers must be served on every party:

(A) an order stating that service is required; (B) a pleading filed after the original complaint, unless the court orders otherwise under Rule 5(c) because there are numerous defendants;

(C) a discovery paper required to be served on a party,

# unless the court orders otherwise;

(D) a written motion, except one that may be heard ex

# parte; and

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 5

(E) a written notice, appearance, demand, or offer of

# judgment, or any similar paper.

(2) If a Party Fails to Appear. No service is required on a party who is in default for failing to appear. But a pleading that asserts a new claim for relief against such a party must be served on that party under Rule 4.

(3) Seizing Property. If an action is begun by seizing property and no person is or need be named as a defendant, any service required before the filing of an appearance, answer, or claim must be made on the person who had custody or possession of the property when it was seized.

# (b) SERVICE: HOW MADE.

(1) Serving an Attorney. If a party is represented by an attor- ney, service under this rule must be made on the attorney un- less the court orders service on the party.

(2) Service in General. A paper is served under this rule by:

(A) handing it to the person; (B) leaving it:

(i) at the person’s office with a clerk or other person in charge or, if no one is in charge, in a conspicuous place in the office; or

(ii) if the person has no office or the office is closed, at the person’s dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there;

(C) mailing it to the person’s last known address—in

which event service is complete upon mailing;

(D) leaving it with the court clerk if the person has no

known address;

(E) sending it to a registered user by filing it with the court’s electronic-filing system or sending it by other elec- tronic means that the person consented to in writing—in either of which events service is complete upon filing or sending, but is not effective if the filer or sender learns that it did not reach the person to be served; or

(F) delivering it by any other means that the person con- sented to in writing—in which event service is complete when the person making service delivers it to the agency designated to make delivery.

(3) Using Court Facilities. [Abrogated (Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec.

# (c) SERVING NUMEROUS DEFENDANTS.

(1) In General. If an action involves an unusually large num- ber of defendants, the court may, on motion or on its own, order that:

(A) defendants’ pleadings and replies to them need not be

served on other defendants;

(B) any crossclaim, counterclaim, avoidance, or affirma- tive defense in those pleadings and replies to them will be treated as denied or avoided by all other parties; and

(C) filing any such pleading and serving it on the plain-

tiff constitutes notice of the pleading to all parties.

(2) Notifying Parties. A copy of every such order must be

served on the parties as the court directs.

# Rule 5

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# (d) FILING.

# (1) Required Filings; Certificate of Service.

(A) Papers after the Complaint. Any paper after the com- plaint that is required to be served must be filed no later than a reasonable time after service. But disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) or (2) and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: depositions, interrog- atories, requests for documents or tangible things or to permit entry onto land, and requests for admission.

(B) Certificate of Service. No certificate of service is re- quired when a paper is served by filing it with the court’s electronic-filing system. When a paper that is required to be served is served by other means:

(i) if the paper is filed, a certificate of service must be filed with it or within a reasonable time after serv- ice; and

(ii) if the paper is not filed, a certificate of service need not be filed unless filing is required by court order or by local rule.

(2) Nonelectronic Filing. A paper not filed electronically is

filed by delivering it:

(A) to the clerk; or (B) to a judge who agrees to accept it for filing, and who must then note the filing date on the paper and promptly send it to the clerk.

# (3) Electronic Filing and Signing.

(A) By a Represented Person—Generally Required; Excep- tions. A person represented by an attorney must file elec- tronically, unless nonelectronic filing is allowed by the court for good cause or is allowed or required by local rule. (B) By an Unrepresented Person—When Allowed or Re-

quired. A person not represented by an attorney:

(i) may file electronically only if allowed by court

# order or by local rule; and

(ii) may be required to file electronically only by court order, or by a local rule that includes reasonable exceptions.

(C) Signing. A filing made through a person’s electronic- filing account and authorized by that person, together with that person’s name on a signature block, constitutes the person’s signature.

(D) Same as a Written Paper. A paper filed electronically

is a written paper for purposes of these rules.

(4) Acceptance by the Clerk. The clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice.

(a) NOTICE BY A PARTY. A party that files a pleading, written motion, or other paper drawing into question the constitutional- ity of a federal or state statute must promptly:

(1) file a notice of constitutional question stating the ques-

tion and identifying the paper that raises it, if:

(A) a federal statute is questioned and the parties do not include the United States, one of its agencies, or one of its officers or employees in an official capacity; or

(B) a state statute is questioned and the parties do not include the state, one of its agencies, or one of its officers or employees in an official capacity; and

(2) serve the notice and paper on the Attorney General of the United States if a federal statute is questioned—or on the state attorney general if a state statute is questioned—either by certified or registered mail or by sending it to an electronic address designated by the attorney general for this purpose. (b) CERTIFICATION BY THE COURT. The court must, under 28 U.S.C. § 2403, certify to the appropriate attorney general that a statute has been questioned.

(c) INTERVENTION; FINAL DECISION ON THE MERITS. Unless the court sets a later time, the attorney general may intervene within 60 days after the notice is filed or after the court certifies the challenge, whichever is earlier. Before the time to intervene ex- pires, the court may reject the constitutional challenge, but may not enter a final judgment holding the statute unconstitutional. (d) NO FORFEITURE. A party’s failure to file and serve the notice, or the court’s failure to certify, does not forfeit a constitutional claim or defense that is otherwise timely asserted.

# Rule 5.2. Privacy Protection For Filings Made with the Court

(a) REDACTED FILINGS. Unless the court orders otherwise, in an electronic or paper filing with the court that contains an individ- ual’s social-security number, taxpayer-identification number, or birth date, the name of an individual known to be a minor, or a financial-account number, a party or nonparty making the filing may include only:

# (1) the last four digits of the social-security number and tax-

# payer-identification number;

(2) the year of the individual’s birth; (3) the minor’s initials; and (4) the last four digits of the financial-account number. (b) EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REDACTION REQUIREMENT. The redac-

tion requirement does not apply to the following:

(1) a financial-account number that identifies the property

# allegedly subject to forfeiture in a forfeiture proceeding;

(2) the record of an administrative or agency proceeding; (3) the official record of a state-court proceeding; (4) the record of a court or tribunal, if that record was not

subject to the redaction requirement when originally filed;

(5) a filing covered by Rule 5.2(c) or (d); and

# Rule 6

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(6) a pro se filing in an action brought under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241,

(c) LIMITATIONS ON REMOTE ACCESS TO ELECTRONIC FILES; SOCIAL- SECURITY APPEALS AND IMMIGRATION CASES. Unless the court or- ders otherwise, in an action for benefits under the Social Security Act, and in an action or proceeding relating to an order of re- moval, to relief from removal, or to immigration benefits or de- tention, access to an electronic file is authorized as follows:

(1) the parties and their attorneys may have remote elec- tronic access to any part of the case file, including the admin- istrative record;

(2) any other person may have electronic access to the full record at the courthouse, but may have remote electronic ac- cess only to:

(A) the docket maintained by the court; and (B) an opinion, order, judgment, or other disposition of the court, but not any other part of the case file or the ad- ministrative record.

(d) FILINGS MADE UNDER SEAL. The court may order that a filing be made under seal without redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing to file a re- dacted version for the public record.

(e) PROTECTIVE ORDERS. For good cause, the court may by order

# in a case:

(1) require redaction of additional information; or (2) limit or prohibit a nonparty’s remote electronic access to

a document filed with the court.

(f) OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL UNREDACTED FILING UNDER SEAL. A person making a redacted filing may also file an unredacted copy under seal. The court must retain the unredacted copy as part of the record.

(g) OPTION FOR FILING A REFERENCE LIST. A filing that contains redacted information may be filed together with a reference list that identifies each item of redacted information and specifies an appropriate identifier that uniquely corresponds to each item list- ed. The list must be filed under seal and may be amended as of right. Any reference in the case to a listed identifier will be con- strued to refer to the corresponding item of information.

(h) WAIVER OF PROTECTION OF IDENTIFIERS. A person waives the protection of Rule 5.2(a) as to the person’s own information by fil- ing it without redaction and not under seal.

# Rule 6. Computing and Extending Time; Time for Motion Papers

(a) COMPUTING TIME. The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules, in any local rule or court order, or in any statute that does not specify a method of comput- ing time.

(1) Period Stated in Days or a Longer Unit. When the period is

stated in days or a longer unit of time:

(A) exclude the day of the event that triggers the period; (B) count every day, including intermediate Saturdays,

# Sundays, and legal holidays; and

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 6

(C) include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period con- tinues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

(2) Period Stated in Hours. When the period is stated in hours: (A) begin counting immediately on the occurrence of the

event that triggers the period;

(B) count every hour, including hours during intermedi-

# ate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays; and

(C) if the period would end on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the period continues to run until the same time on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

(3) Inaccessibility of the Clerk’s Office. Unless the court orders

otherwise, if the clerk’s office is inaccessible:

(A) on the last day for filing under Rule 6(a)(1), then the time for filing is extended to the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday; or

(B) during the last hour for filing under Rule 6(a)(2), then the time for filing is extended to the same time on the first accessible day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.

(4) ‘‘Last Day’’ Defined. Unless a different time is set by a

statute, local rule, or court order, the last day ends:

# (A) for electronic filing, at midnight in the court’s time

# zone; and

(B) for filing by other means, when the clerk’s office is

scheduled to close.

(5) ‘‘Next Day’’ Defined. The ‘‘next day’’ is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event. (6) ‘‘Legal Holiday’’ Defined. ‘‘Legal holiday’’ means:

(B) any day declared a holiday by the President or Con-

# gress; and

(C) for periods that are measured after an event, any other day declared a holiday by the state where the dis- trict court is located.

# (b) EXTENDING TIME.

(1) In General. When an act may or must be done within a specified time, the court may, for good cause, extend the time: (A) with or without motion or notice if the court acts, or if a request is made, before the original time or its ex- tension expires; or

(B) on motion made after the time has expired if the

party failed to act because of excusable neglect.

(2) Exceptions. A court must not extend the time to act under

# (c) MOTIONS, NOTICES OF HEARING, AND AFFIDAVITS.

(1) In General. A written motion and notice of the hearing must be served at least 14 days before the time specified for the hearing, with the following exceptions:

# Rule 7

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(A) when the motion may be heard ex parte; (B) when these rules set a different time; or (C) when a court order—which a party may, for good

cause, apply for ex parte—sets a different time.

(2) Supporting Affidavit. Any affidavit supporting a motion must be served with the motion. Except as Rule 59(c) provides otherwise, any opposing affidavit must be served at least 7 days before the hearing, unless the court permits service at another time.

(d) ADDITIONAL TIME AFTER CERTAIN KINDS OF SERVICE. When a party may or must act within a specified time after being served and service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(C) (mail), (D) (leaving with the clerk), or (F) (other means consented to), 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a).

# TITLE III. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

# Rule 7. Pleadings Allowed; Form of Motions and Other Papers

(a) PLEADINGS. Only these pleadings are allowed:

(1) a complaint; (2) an answer to a complaint; (3) an answer to a counterclaim designated as a counter-

# claim;

# (b) MOTIONS AND OTHER PAPERS.

(1) In General. A request for a court order must be made by

# motion. The motion must:

(A) be in writing unless made during a hearing or trial; (B) state with particularity the grounds for seeking the

# order; and

# (C) state the relief sought.

(2) Form. The rules governing captions and other matters of

form in pleadings apply to motions and other papers.

# Rule 7.1. Disclosure Statement

# (a) WHO MUST FILE; CONTENTS.

(1) Nongovernmental Corporations. A nongovernmental cor- porate party or a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to intervene must file a statement that:

(A) identifies any parent corporation and any publicly

held corporation owning 10% or more of its stock; or

(B) states that there is no such corporation.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 8

(2) Parties or Intervenors in a Diversity Case. In an action in which jurisdiction is based on diversity under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), a party or intervenor must, unless the court orders otherwise, file a disclosure statement. The statement must name—and identify the citizenship of—every individual or en- tity whose citizenship is attributed to that party or interve- nor:

(A) when the action is filed in or removed to federal

# court, and

(B) when any later event occurs that could affect the

court’s jurisdiction under § 1332(a).

(b) TIME TO FILE; SUPPLEMENTAL FILING. A party, intervenor, or

proposed intervenor must:

(1) file the disclosure statement with its first appearance, pleading, petition, motion, response, or other request ad- dressed to the court; and

(2) promptly file a supplemental statement if any required

# information changes.

# Rule 8. General Rules of Pleading

(a) CLAIM FOR RELIEF. A pleading that states a claim for relief

must contain:

(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s jurisdiction, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the claim needs no new jurisdictional support;

(2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the

pleader is entitled to relief; and

(3) a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief

# in the alternative or different types of relief.

# (b) DEFENSES; ADMISSIONS AND DENIALS.

(1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must:

# (A) state in short and plain terms its defenses to each

claim asserted against it; and

(B) admit or deny the allegations asserted against it by

an opposing party.

(2) Denials—Responding to the Substance. A denial must fairly

# respond to the substance of the allegation.

(3) General and Specific Denials. A party that intends in good faith to deny all the allegations of a pleading—including the jurisdictional grounds—may do so by a general denial. A party that does not intend to deny all the allegations must either specifically deny designated allegations or generally deny all except those specifically admitted.

(4) Denying Part of an Allegation. A party that intends in good faith to deny only part of an allegation must admit the part that is true and deny the rest.

(5) Lacking Knowledge or Information. A party that lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation must so state, and the statement has the effect of a denial.

(6) Effect of Failing to Deny. An allegation—other than one relating to the amount of damages—is admitted if a responsive

# Rule 9

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

pleading is required and the allegation is not denied. If a re- sponsive pleading is not required, an allegation is considered denied or avoided.

# (c) AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES.

(1) In General. In responding to a pleading, a party must af- firmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense, includ- ing:

(2) Mistaken Designation. If a party mistakenly designates a defense as a counterclaim, or a counterclaim as a defense, the court must, if justice requires, treat the pleading as though it were correctly designated, and may impose terms for doing so. (d) PLEADING TO BE CONCISE AND DIRECT; ALTERNATIVE STATE-

(1) In General. Each allegation must be simple, concise, and

direct. No technical form is required.

(2) Alternative Statements of a Claim or Defense. A party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alter- natively or hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is sufficient if any one of them is sufficient.

(3) Inconsistent Claims or Defenses. A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consist- ency.

(e) CONSTRUING PLEADINGS. Pleadings must be construed so as to

do justice.

# Rule 9. Pleading Special Matters

# (a) CAPACITY OR AUTHORITY TO SUE; LEGAL EXISTENCE.

(1) In General. Except when required to show that the court

has jurisdiction, a pleading need not allege:

(A) a party’s capacity to sue or be sued; (B) a party’s authority to sue or be sued in a representa-

# tive capacity; or

(C) the legal existence of an organized association of per-

sons that is made a party.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 10

(2) Raising Those Issues. To raise any of those issues, a party must do so by a specific denial, which must state any support- ing facts that are peculiarly within the party’s knowledge.

(b) FRAUD OR MISTAKE; CONDITIONS OF MIND. In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person’s mind may be alleged generally.

(c) CONDITIONS PRECEDENT. In pleading conditions precedent, it suffices to allege generally that all conditions precedent have oc- curred or been performed. But when denying that a condition precedent has occurred or been performed, a party must do so with particularity.

(d) OFFICIAL DOCUMENT OR ACT. In pleading an official document or official act, it suffices to allege that the document was legally issued or the act legally done.

(e) JUDGMENT. In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or foreign court, a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or a board or officer, it suffices to plead the judgment or decision without showing jurisdiction to render it.

(f) TIME AND PLACE. An allegation of time or place is material

when testing the sufficiency of a pleading.

(g) SPECIAL DAMAGES. If an item of special damage is claimed,

it must be specifically stated.

# (h) ADMIRALTY OR MARITIME CLAIM.

(1) How Designated. If a claim for relief is within the admi- ralty or maritime jurisdiction and also within the court’s sub- ject-matter jurisdiction on some other ground, the pleading may designate the claim as an admiralty or maritime claim for purposes of Rules 14(c), 38(e), and 82 and the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions. A claim cognizable only in the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction is an admiralty or maritime claim for those pur- poses, whether or not so designated.

(2) Designation for Appeal. A case that includes an admiralty or maritime claim within this subdivision (h) is an admiralty case within 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(3).

# Rule 10. Form of Pleadings

(a) CAPTION; NAMES OF PARTIES. Every pleading must have a cap- tion with the court’s name, a title, a file number, and a Rule 7(a) designation. The title of the complaint must name all the parties; the title of other pleadings, after naming the first party on each side, may refer generally to other parties.

(b) PARAGRAPHS; SEPARATE STATEMENTS. A party must state its claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs, each limited as far as practicable to a single set of circumstances. A later pleading may refer by number to a paragraph in an earlier pleading. If doing so would promote clarity, each claim founded on a separate trans- action or occurrence—and each defense other than a denial—must be stated in a separate count or defense.

# Rule 11

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(c) ADOPTION BY REFERENCE; EXHIBITS. A statement in a pleading may be adopted by reference elsewhere in the same pleading or in any other pleading or motion. A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all pur- poses.

# Rule 11. Signing Pleadings, Motions, and Other Papers; Represen-

# tations to the Court; Sanctions

(a) SIGNATURE. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney’s name—or by a party personally if the party is unrepresented. The paper must state the signer’s address, e-mail address, and tele- phone number. Unless a rule or statute specifically states other- wise, a pleading need not be verified or accompanied by an affida- vit. The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected after being called to the attorney’s or par- ty’s attention.

(b) REPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT. By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrep- resented party certifies that to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:

(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;

(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are war- ranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for ex- tending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establish- ing new law;

(3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or dis- covery; and

(4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a lack of information.

# (c) SANCTIONS.

(1) In General. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, the court determines that Rule 11(b) has been vio- lated, the court may impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that violated the rule or is re- sponsible for the violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm must be held jointly responsible for a violation committed by its partner, associate, or employee.

(2) Motion for Sanctions. A motion for sanctions must be made separately from any other motion and must describe the specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b). The motion must be served under Rule 5, but it must not be filed or be pre- sented to the court if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets. If warranted, the court may award to the prevailing

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 12

party the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, in- curred for the motion.

(3) On the Court’s Initiative. On its own, the court may order an attorney, law firm, or party to show cause why conduct specifically described in the order has not violated Rule 11(b). (4) Nature of a Sanction. A sanction imposed under this rule must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the con- duct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated. The sanction may include nonmonetary directives; an order to pay a penalty into court; or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing payment to the movant of part or all of the reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation.

(5) Limitations on Monetary Sanctions. The court must not im-

pose a monetary sanction:

(A) against a represented party for violating Rule

(B) on its own, unless it issued the show-cause order under Rule 11(c)(3) before voluntary dismissal or settle- ment of the claims made by or against the party that is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned.

(6) Requirements for an Order. An order imposing a sanction must describe the sanctioned conduct and explain the basis for the sanction.

(d) INAPPLICABILITY TO DISCOVERY. This rule does not apply to disclosures and discovery requests, responses, objections, and mo- tions under Rules 26 through 37.

# (a) TIME TO SERVE A RESPONSIVE PLEADING.

(1) In General. Unless another time is specified by this rule or a federal statute, the time for serving a responsive pleading is as follows:

(A) A defendant must serve an answer:

(i) within 21 days after being served with the sum-

# mons and complaint; or

(ii) if it has timely waived service under Rule 4(d), within 60 days after the request for a waiver was sent, or within 90 days after it was sent to the defendant outside any judicial district of the United States.

(B) A party must serve an answer to a counterclaim or crossclaim within 21 days after being served with the pleading that states the counterclaim or crossclaim.

(C) A party must serve a reply to an answer within 21 days after being served with an order to reply, unless the order specifies a different time.

(2) United States and Its Agencies, Officers, or Employees Sued in an Official Capacity. The United States, a United States agency, or a United States officer or employee sued only in an

# Rule 12

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

official capacity must serve an answer to a complaint, coun- terclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the United States attorney.

(3) United States Officers or Employees Sued in an Individual Capacity. A United States officer or employee sued in an indi- vidual capacity for an act or omission occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States’ behalf must serve an answer to a complaint, counterclaim, or crossclaim within 60 days after service on the officer or employee or service on the United States attorney, whichever is later.

(4) Effect of a Motion. Unless the court sets a different time, serving a motion under this rule alters these periods as fol- lows:

(A) if the court denies the motion or postpones its dis- position until trial, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after notice of the court’s action; or

(B) if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after the more definite statement is served. (b) HOW TO PRESENT DEFENSES. Every defense to a claim for re- lief in any pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading if one is required. But a party may assert the following defenses by motion:

(1) lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; (2) lack of personal jurisdiction; (3) improper venue; (4) insufficient process; (5) insufficient service of process; (6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted;

# and

(7) failure to join a party under Rule 19.

A motion asserting any of these defenses must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed. If a pleading sets out a claim for relief that does not require a responsive pleading, an opposing party may assert at trial any defense to that claim. No defense or objection is waived by joining it with one or more other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or in a motion.

(c) MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS. After the pleadings are closed—but early enough not to delay trial—a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.

(d) RESULT OF PRESENTING MATTERS OUTSIDE THE PLEADINGS. If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the plead- ings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.

(e) MOTION FOR A MORE DEFINITE STATEMENT. A party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading to which a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or ambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response. The motion must be made before filing a responsive pleading and must point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the court orders a more definite statement and the order is not obeyed within 14 days after notice of the order or within the time the court sets, the court may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate order.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 13

(f) MOTION TO STRIKE. The court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. The court may act:

(1) on its own; or (2) on motion made by a party either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being served with the pleading.

# (g) JOINING MOTIONS.

(1) Right to Join. A motion under this rule may be joined with

any other motion allowed by this rule.

(2) Limitation on Further Motions. Except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under this rule must not make another motion under this rule raising a de- fense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.

# (h) WAIVING AND PRESERVING CERTAIN DEFENSES.

(1) When Some Are Waived. A party waives any defense listed

(A) omitting it from a motion in the circumstances de-

scribed in Rule 12(g)(2); or

(B) failing to either:

(i) make it by motion under this rule; or (ii) include it in a responsive pleading or in an amendment allowed by Rule 15(a)(1) as a matter of course.

(2) When to Raise Others. Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, to join a person required by Rule 19(b), or to state a legal defense to a claim may be raised:

(A) in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a); (B) by a motion under Rule 12(c); or (C) at trial.

(3) Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.

(i) HEARING BEFORE TRIAL. If a party so moves, any defense list- ed in Rule 12(b)(1)–(7)—whether made in a pleading or by motion— and a motion under Rule 12(c) must be heard and decided before trial unless the court orders a deferral until trial.

# Rule 13. Counterclaim and Crossclaim

# (a) COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM.

(1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that—at the time of its service—the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim:

(A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is

the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim; and

(B) does not require adding another party over whom the

court cannot acquire jurisdiction.

# (2) Exceptions. The pleader need not state the claim if:

(A) when the action was commenced, the claim was the

subject of another pending action; or

# Rule 14

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(B) the opposing party sued on its claim by attachment or other process that did not establish personal jurisdic- tion over the pleader on that claim, and the pleader does not assert any counterclaim under this rule.

(b) PERMISSIVE COUNTERCLAIM. A pleading may state as a coun- terclaim against an opposing party any claim that is not compul- sory.

(c) RELIEF SOUGHT IN A COUNTERCLAIM. A counterclaim need not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may request relief that exceeds in amount or differs in kind from the relief sought by the opposing party.

(d) COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. These rules do not expand the right to assert a counterclaim—or to claim a cred- it—against the United States or a United States officer or agency. (e) COUNTERCLAIM MATURING OR ACQUIRED AFTER PLEADING. The court may permit a party to file a supplemental pleading assert- ing a counterclaim that matured or was acquired by the party after serving an earlier pleading.

(f) [ABROGATED.] (g) CROSSCLAIM AGAINST A COPARTY. A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim as- serted in the action against the crossclaimant.

(h) JOINING ADDITIONAL PARTIES. Rules 19 and 20 govern the addi-

# tion of a person as a party to a counterclaim or crossclaim.

(i) SEPARATE TRIALS; SEPARATE JUDGMENTS. If the court orders separate trials under Rule 42(b), it may enter judgment on a coun- terclaim or crossclaim under Rule 54(b) when it has jurisdiction to do so, even if the opposing party’s claims have been dismissed or otherwise resolved.

# Rule 14. Third-Party Practice

# (a) WHEN A DEFENDING PARTY MAY BRING IN A THIRD PARTY.

(1) Timing of the Summons and Complaint. A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it for all or part of the claim against it. But the third-party plaintiff must, by motion, obtain the court’s leave if it files the third-party com- plaint more than 14 days after serving its original answer.

(2) Third-Party Defendant’s Claims and Defenses. The person served with the summons and third-party complaint—the ‘‘third-party defendant’’:

(A) must assert any defense against the third-party

# plaintiff’s claim under Rule 12;

(B) must assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counter- claim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(b) or

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 14

# any crossclaim against another third-party defendant under Rule 13(g);

(C) may assert against the plaintiff any defense that the

third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff’s claim; and

(D) may also assert against the plaintiff any claim aris- ing out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff.

(3) Plaintiff’s Claims Against a Third-Party Defendant. The plaintiff may assert against the third-party defendant any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff. The third-party defendant must then assert any de- fense under Rule 12 and any counterclaim under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim under Rule 13(g).

(4) Motion to Strike, Sever, or Try Separately. Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, to sever it, or to try it separately.

(5) Third-Party Defendant’s Claim Against a Nonparty. A third- party defendant may proceed under this rule against a non- party who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of any claim against it.

(6) Third-Party Complaint In Rem. If it is within the admi- ralty or maritime jurisdiction, a third-party complaint may be in rem. In that event, a reference in this rule to the ‘‘sum- mons’’ includes the warrant of arrest, and a reference to the defendant or third-party plaintiff includes, when appropriate, a person who asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) in the property arrested.

(b) WHEN A PLAINTIFF MAY BRING IN A THIRD PARTY. When a claim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring in a third party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so.

# (c) ADMIRALTY OR MARITIME CLAIM.

(1) Scope of Impleader. If a plaintiff asserts an admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h), the defendant or a person who asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) may, as a third-party plaintiff, bring in a third-party defendant who may be wholly or partly liable—either to the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff—for remedy over, contribution, or otherwise on account of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.

(2) Defending Against a Demand for Judgment for the Plaintiff. The third-party plaintiff may demand judgment in the plain- tiff’s favor against the third-party defendant. In that event, the third-party defendant must defend under Rule 12 against the plaintiff’s claim as well as the third-party plaintiff’s claim; and the action proceeds as if the plaintiff had sued both the third-party defendant and the third-party plaintiff.

# Rule 15

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 15. Amended and Supplemental Pleadings

# (a) AMENDMENTS BEFORE TRIAL.

(1) Amending as a Matter of Course. A party may amend its

pleading once as a matter of course within:

(A) 21 days after serving it, or (B) if the pleading is one to which a responsive pleading is required, 21 days after service of a responsive pleading or 21 days after service of a motion under Rule 12(b), (e), or (f), whichever is earlier.

(2) Other Amendments. In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave. The court should freely give leave when jus- tice so requires.

(3) Time to Respond. Unless the court orders otherwise, any required response to an amended pleading must be made with- in the time remaining to respond to the original pleading or within 14 days after service of the amended pleading, which- ever is later.

# (b) AMENDMENTS DURING AND AFTER TRIAL.

(1) Based on an Objection at Trial. If, at trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party’s ac- tion or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continu- ance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence.

(2) For Issues Tried by Consent. When an issue not raised by the pleadings is tried by the parties’ express or implied con- sent, it must be treated in all respects as if raised in the plead- ings. A party may move—at any time, even after judgment— to amend the pleadings to conform them to the evidence and to raise an unpleaded issue. But failure to amend does not af- fect the result of the trial of that issue.

# (c) RELATION BACK OF AMENDMENTS.

(1) When an Amendment Relates Back. An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:

(A) the law that provides the applicable statute of limi-

tations allows relation back;

(B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out—or attempted to be set out—in the original pleading; or

(C) the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:

(i) received such notice of the action that it will not

be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and

(ii) knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party’s identity.

(2) Notice to the United States. When the United States or a United States officer or agency is added as a defendant by

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 16

amendment, the notice requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and (ii) are satisfied if, during the stated period, process was deliv- ered or mailed to the United States attorney or the United States attorney’s designee, to the Attorney General of the United States, or to the officer or agency.

(d) SUPPLEMENTAL PLEADINGS. On motion and reasonable notice, the court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supple- mental pleading setting out any transaction, occurrence, or event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented. The court may permit supplementation even though the original pleading is defective in stating a claim or defense. The court may order that the opposing party plead to the supplemental pleading within a specified time.

# Rule 16. Pretrial Conferences; Scheduling; Management

(a) PURPOSES OF A PRETRIAL CONFERENCE. In any action, the court may order the attorneys and any unrepresented parties to appear for one or more pretrial conferences for such purposes as:

(1) expediting disposition of the action; (2) establishing early and continuing control so that the case

will not be protracted because of lack of management;

(3) discouraging wasteful pretrial activities; (4) improving the quality of the trial through more thorough

# preparation; and

# (5) facilitating settlement.

# (b) SCHEDULING.

(1) Scheduling Order. Except in categories of actions exempt- ed by local rule, the district judge—or a magistrate judge when authorized by local rule—must issue a scheduling order: (A) after receiving the parties’ report under Rule 26(f); or (B) after consulting with the parties’ attorneys and any

unrepresented parties at a scheduling conference.

(2) Time to Issue. The judge must issue the scheduling order as soon as practicable, but unless the judge finds good cause for delay, the judge must issue it within the earlier of 90 days after any defendant has been served with the complaint or 60 days after any defendant has appeared.

# (3) Contents of the Order.

(A) Required Contents. The scheduling order must limit the time to join other parties, amend the pleadings, com- plete discovery, and file motions.

(B) Permitted Contents. The scheduling order may:

(i) modify the timing of disclosures under Rules 26(a)

(ii) modify the extent of discovery; (iii) provide for disclosure, discovery, or preservation

of electronically stored information;

(iv) include any agreements the parties reach for as- serting claims of privilege or of protection as trial-

# Rule 16

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

preparation material after information is produced, in- cluding agreements reached under Federal Rule of Evi- dence 502;

(v) direct that before moving for an order relating to discovery, the movant must request a conference with the court;

# (vi) set dates for pretrial conferences and for trial;

# and

(vii) include other appropriate matters.

(4) Modifying a Schedule. A schedule may be modified only for

# good cause and with the judge’s consent.

# (c) ATTENDANCE AND MATTERS FOR CONSIDERATION AT A PRETRIAL

(1) Attendance. A represented party must authorize at least one of its attorneys to make stipulations and admissions about all matters that can reasonably be anticipated for dis- cussion at a pretrial conference. If appropriate, the court may require that a party or its representative be present or reason- ably available by other means to consider possible settlement. (2) Matters for Consideration. At any pretrial conference, the court may consider and take appropriate action on the follow- ing matters:

(A) formulating and simplifying the issues, and eliminat-

ing frivolous claims or defenses;

(B) amending the pleadings if necessary or desirable; (C) obtaining admissions and stipulations about facts and documents to avoid unnecessary proof, and ruling in advance on the admissibility of evidence;

(D) avoiding unnecessary proof and cumulative evidence, and limiting the use of testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702;

(E) determining the appropriateness and timing of sum-

# mary adjudication under Rule 56;

(F) controlling and scheduling discovery, including or- ders affecting disclosures and discovery under Rule 26 and Rules 29 through 37;

(G) identifying witnesses and documents, scheduling the filing and exchange of any pretrial briefs, and setting dates for further conferences and for trial;

(H) referring matters to a magistrate judge or a master; (I) settling the case and using special procedures to as- sist in resolving the dispute when authorized by statute or local rule;

(J) determining the form and content of the pretrial

# order;

(K) disposing of pending motions; (L) adopting special procedures for managing potentially difficult or protracted actions that may involve complex issues, multiple parties, difficult legal questions, or un- usual proof problems;

(M) ordering a separate trial under Rule 42(b) of a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, third-party claim, or particular issue;

(N) ordering the presentation of evidence early in the trial on a manageable issue that might, on the evidence,

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 17

be the basis for a judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) or a judgment on partial findings under Rule 52(c);

(O) establishing a reasonable limit on the time allowed

# to present evidence; and

# (P) facilitating in other ways the just, speedy, and inex-

# pensive disposition of the action.

(d) PRETRIAL ORDERS. After any conference under this rule, the court should issue an order reciting the action taken. This order controls the course of the action unless the court modifies it.

(e) FINAL PRETRIAL CONFERENCE AND ORDERS. The court may hold a final pretrial conference to formulate a trial plan, includ- ing a plan to facilitate the admission of evidence. The conference must be held as close to the start of trial as is reasonable, and must be attended by at least one attorney who will conduct the trial for each party and by any unrepresented party. The court may modify the order issued after a final pretrial conference only to prevent manifest injustice.

# (f) SANCTIONS.

(1) In General. On motion or on its own, the court may issue including those authorized by Rule

# any 37(b)(2)(A)(ii)–(vii), if a party or its attorney:

(A) fails to appear at a scheduling or other pretrial con-

# ference;

(B) is substantially unprepared to participate—or does

not participate in good faith—in the conference; or

(C) fails to obey a scheduling or other pretrial order. (2) Imposing Fees and Costs. Instead of or in addition to any other sanction, the court must order the party, its attorney, or both to pay the reasonable expenses—including attorney’s fees—incurred because of any noncompliance with this rule, unless the noncompliance was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

# TITLE IV. PARTIES

# Rule 17. Plaintiff and Defendant; Capacity; Public Officers

# (a) REAL PARTY IN INTEREST.

(1) Designation in General. An action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. The following may sue in their own names without joining the person for whose bene- fit the action is brought:

(A) an executor; (B) an administrator; (C) a guardian; (D) a bailee; (E) a trustee of an express trust; (F) a party with whom or in whose name a contract has

been made for another’s benefit; and (G) a party authorized by statute.

(2) Action in the Name of the United States for Another’s Use or Benefit. When a federal statute so provides, an action for an- other’s use or benefit must be brought in the name of the United States.

# Rule 18

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(3) Joinder of the Real Party in Interest. The court may not dismiss an action for failure to prosecute in the name of the real party in interest until, after an objection, a reasonable time has been allowed for the real party in interest to ratify, join, or be substituted into the action. After ratification, join- der, or substitution, the action proceeds as if it had been origi- nally commenced by the real party in interest.

(b) CAPACITY TO SUE OR BE SUED. Capacity to sue or be sued is

determined as follows:

(1) for an individual who is not acting in a representative ca-

# pacity, by the law of the individual’s domicile;

(2) for a corporation, by the law under which it was orga-

nized; and

court is located, except that:

(A) a partnership or other unincorporated association with no such capacity under that state’s law may sue or be sued in its common name to enforce a substantive right existing under the United States Constitution or laws; and (B) 28 U.S.C. §§ 754 and 959(a) govern the capacity of a re- ceiver appointed by a United States court to sue or be sued in a United States court. (c) MINOR OR INCOMPETENT PERSON.

(1) With a Representative. The following representatives may sue or defend on behalf of a minor or an incompetent person:

(2) Without a Representative. A minor or an incompetent per- son who does not have a duly appointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court must appoint a guardian ad litem—or issue another appropriate order—to protect a minor or incompetent person who is unrep- resented in an action.

(d) PUBLIC OFFICER’S TITLE AND NAME. A public officer who sues or is sued in an official capacity may be designated by official title rather than by name, but the court may order that the offi- cer’s name be added. (As amended Dec. 27, 1946, eff. Mar. 19, 1948; Dec. 29, 1948, eff. Oct. 20, 1949; Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Aug. 1, 1988; Pub. L. 100–690, title VII, § 7049, Nov. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 4401; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 18. Joinder of Claims

(a) IN GENERAL. A party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, as independent or alter- native claims, as many claims as it has against an opposing party. (b) JOINDER OF CONTINGENT CLAIMS. A party may join two claims even though one of them is contingent on the disposition of the other; but the court may grant relief only in accordance with the parties’ relative substantive rights. In particular, a plaintiff may state a claim for money and a claim to set aside a conveyance that is fraudulent as to that plaintiff, without first obtaining a judgment for the money.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 20

# Rule 19. Required Joinder of Parties

# (a) PERSONS REQUIRED TO BE JOINED IF FEASIBLE.

(1) Required Party. A person who is subject to service of proc- ess and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject- matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if:

(A) in that person’s absence, the court cannot accord

complete relief among existing parties; or

(B) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person’s absence may:

(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the per-

son’s ability to protect the interest; or

(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise incon- sistent obligations because of the interest.

(2) Joinder by Court Order. If a person has not been joined as required, the court must order that the person be made a party. A person who refuses to join as a plaintiff may be made either a defendant or, in a proper case, an involuntary plain- tiff.

(3) Venue. If a joined party objects to venue and the joinder would make venue improper, the court must dismiss that party.

(b) WHEN JOINDER IS NOT FEASIBLE. If a person who is required to be joined if feasible cannot be joined, the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors for the court to consider include:

(1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person’s

absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties;

(2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or

avoided by:

(A) protective provisions in the judgment; (B) shaping the relief; or (C) other measures;

(3) whether a judgment rendered in the person’s absence

would be adequate; and

(4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if

the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.

(c) PLEADING THE REASONS FOR NONJOINDER. When asserting a

# claim for relief, a party must state:

(1) the name, if known, of any person who is required to be

joined if feasible but is not joined; and

(2) the reasons for not joining that person.

(d) EXCEPTION FOR CLASS ACTIONS. This rule is subject to Rule

# Rule 20. Permissive Joinder of Parties

# (a) PERSONS WHO MAY JOIN OR BE JOINED.

# Rule 21

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(1) Plaintiffs. Persons may join in one action as plaintiffs if: (A) they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences; and

# (B) any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs

will arise in the action.

(2) Defendants. Persons—as well as a vessel, cargo, or other property subject to admiralty process in rem—may be joined in one action as defendants if:

(A) any right to relief is asserted against them jointly, severally, or in the alternative with respect to or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of trans- actions or occurrences; and

# (B) any question of law or fact common to all defendants

will arise in the action.

(3) Extent of Relief. Neither a plaintiff nor a defendant need be interested in obtaining or defending against all the relief demanded. The court may grant judgment to one or more plaintiffs according to their rights, and against one or more defendants according to their liabilities.

(b) PROTECTIVE MEASURES. The court may issue orders—includ- ing an order for separate trials—to protect a party against embar- rassment, delay, expense, or other prejudice that arises from in- cluding a person against whom the party asserts no claim and who asserts no claim against the party. (As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 21. Misjoinder and Nonjoinder of Parties

Misjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissing an action. On motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add or drop a party. The court may also sever any claim against a party. (As amended Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 22. Interpleader

# (a) GROUNDS.

(1) By a Plaintiff. Persons with claims that may expose a plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined as de- fendants and required to interplead. Joinder for interpleader is proper even though:

(A) the claims of the several claimants, or the titles on which their claims depend, lack a common origin or are adverse and independent rather than identical; or

(B) the plaintiff denies liability in whole or in part to

# any or all of the claimants.

(2) By a Defendant. A defendant exposed to similar liability may seek interpleader through a crossclaim or counterclaim. (b) RELATION TO OTHER RULES AND STATUTES. This rule supple- ments—and does not limit—the joinder of parties allowed by Rule 20. The remedy this rule provides is in addition to—and does not supersede or limit—the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1335, 1397, and 2361. An action under those statutes must be conducted under these rules.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 23

# Rule 23. Class Actions

(a) PREREQUISITES. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is

# impracticable;

(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are

# typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and

# (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately pro-

tect the interests of the class.

(b) TYPES OF CLASS ACTIONS. A class action may be maintained

if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if:

(1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual

class members would create a risk of:

(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class members that would establish incompat- ible standards of conduct for the party opposing the class; or

(B) adjudications with respect to individual class mem- bers that, as a practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other members not parties to the indi- vidual adjudications or would substantially impair or im- pede their ability to protect their interests;

(2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final in- junctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appro- priate respecting the class as a whole; or

(3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings in- clude:

(A) the class members’ interests in individually control-

ling the prosecution or defense of separate actions;

(B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class mem- bers;

(C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating

the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.

# (c) CERTIFICATION ORDER; NOTICE TO CLASS MEMBERS; JUDGMENT;

# (1) Certification Order.

(A) Time to Issue. At an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.

(B) Defining the Class; Appointing Class Counsel. An order that certifies a class action must define the class and the class claims, issues, or defenses, and must appoint class counsel under Rule 23(g).

# Rule 23

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(C) Altering or Amending the Order. An order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended be- fore final judgment.

# (2) Notice.

(A) For (b)(1) or (b)(2) Classes. For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), the court may direct appro- priate notice to the class.

(B) For (b)(3) Classes. For any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3)—or upon ordering notice under Rule 23(e)(1) to a class proposed to be certified for purposes of settlement under Rule 23(b)(3)—the court must direct to class mem- bers the best notice that is practicable under the circum- stances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. The notice may be by one or more of the following: United States mail, electronic means, or other appropriate means. The notice must clearly and concisely state in plain, easily un- derstood language:

(i) the nature of the action; (ii) the definition of the class certified; (iii) the class claims, issues, or defenses; (iv) that a class member may enter an appearance

through an attorney if the member so desires;

(v) that the court will exclude from the class any

member who requests exclusion;

(vi) the time and manner for requesting exclusion;

# and

(vii) the binding effect of a class judgment on mem-

# bers under Rule 23(c)(3).

# (3) Judgment. Whether or not favorable to the class, the judg-

# ment in a class action must:

(A) for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(1) or (b)(2), in- clude and describe those whom the court finds to be class members; and

(B) for any class certified under Rule 23(b)(3), include and specify or describe those to whom the Rule 23(c)(2) notice was directed, who have not requested exclusion, and whom the court finds to be class members.

(4) Particular Issues. When appropriate, an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to par- ticular issues.

(5) Subclasses. When appropriate, a class may be divided into

subclasses that are each treated as a class under this rule.

# (d) CONDUCTING THE ACTION.

(1) In General. In conducting an action under this rule, the

court may issue orders that:

(A) determine the course of proceedings or prescribe measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in presenting evidence or argument;

(B) require—to protect class members and fairly conduct the action—giving appropriate notice to some or all class members of:

(i) any step in the action; (ii) the proposed extent of the judgment; or (iii) the members’ opportunity to signify whether they consider the representation fair and adequate, to

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 23

intervene and present claims or defenses, or to other- wise come into the action;

(C) impose conditions on the representative parties or on

# intervenors;

(D) require that the pleadings be amended to eliminate allegations about representation of absent persons and that the action proceed accordingly; or

# (E) deal with similar procedural matters.

(2) Combining and Amending Orders. An order under Rule 23(d)(1) may be altered or amended from time to time and may be combined with an order under Rule 16.

(e) SETTLEMENT, VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL, OR COMPROMISE. The claims, issues, or defenses of a certified class—or a class proposed to be certified for purposes of settlement—may be settled, volun- tarily dismissed, or compromised only with the court’s approval. The following procedures apply to a proposed settlement, vol- untary dismissal, or compromise: (1) Notice to the Class.

(A) Information That Parties Must Provide to the Court. The parties must provide the court with information sufficient to enable it to determine whether to give notice of the pro- posal to the class.

(B) Grounds for a Decision to Give Notice. The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal if giving notice is jus- tified by the parties’ showing that the court will likely be able to:

(i) approve the proposal under Rule 23(e)(2); and (ii) certify the class for purposes of judgment on the

# proposal.

(2) Approval of the Proposal. If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and only on finding that it is fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering whether:

(A) the class representatives and class counsel have ade-

quately represented the class;

(B) the proposal was negotiated at arm’s length; (C) the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking

# into account:

(i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; (ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of dis- tributing relief to the class, including the method of processing class-member claims;

(iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney’s

fees, including timing of payment; and

(iv) any agreement required to be identified under

# Rule 23(e)(3); and

(D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative

# to each other.

(3) Identifying Agreements. The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connec- tion with the proposal.

(4) New Opportunity to Be Excluded. If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it affords a new opportunity to

# Rule 23

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

request exclusion to individual class members who had an ear- lier opportunity to request exclusion but did not do so.

# (5) Class-Member Objections.

(A) In General. Any class member may object to the pro- posal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e). The objection must state whether it applies only to the objector, to a specific subset of the class, or to the en- tire class, and also state with specificity the grounds for the objection.

(B) Court Approval Required for Payment in Connection with an Objection. Unless approved by the court after a hearing, no payment or other consideration may be pro- vided in connection with:

(i) forgoing or withdrawing an objection, or (ii) forgoing, dismissing, or abandoning an appeal

from a judgment approving the proposal.

(C) Procedure for Approval After an Appeal. If approval under Rule 23(e)(5)(B) has not been obtained before an ap- peal is docketed in the court of appeals, the procedure of Rule 62.1 applies while the appeal remains pending.

(f) APPEALS. A court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying class-action certification under this rule, but not from an order under Rule 23(e)(1). A party must file a petition for permission to appeal with the circuit clerk within 14 days after the order is entered, or within 45 days after the order is entered if any party is the United States, a United States agen- cy, or a United States officer or employee sued for an act or omis- sion occurring in connection with duties performed on the United States’ behalf. An appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.

# (g) CLASS COUNSEL.

(1) Appointing Class Counsel. Unless a statute provides other- wise, a court that certifies a class must appoint class counsel. In appointing class counsel, the court:

(A) must consider:

(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or inves-

tigating potential claims in the action;

(ii) counsel’s experience in handling class actions, other complex litigation, and the types of claims as- serted in the action;

(iii) counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and (iv) the resources that counsel will commit to rep-

resenting the class;

(B) may consider any other matter pertinent to counsel’s ability to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the class;

(C) may order potential class counsel to provide informa- tion on any subject pertinent to the appointment and to propose terms for attorney’s fees and nontaxable costs;

(D) may include in the appointing order provisions about the award of attorney’s fees or nontaxable costs under Rule 23(h); and

(E) may make further orders in connection with the ap-

# pointment.

(2) Standard for Appointing Class Counsel. When one applicant seeks appointment as class counsel, the court may appoint

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 23.1

that applicant only if the applicant is adequate under Rule 23(g)(1) and (4). If more than one adequate applicant seeks ap- pointment, the court must appoint the applicant best able to represent the interests of the class.

(3) Interim Counsel. The court may designate interim counsel to act on behalf of a putative class before determining whether to certify the action as a class action.

(4) Duty of Class Counsel. Class counsel must fairly and ade-

quately represent the interests of the class.

(h) ATTORNEY’S FEES AND NONTAXABLE COSTS. In a certified class action, the court may award reasonable attorney’s fees and non- taxable costs that are authorized by law or by the parties’ agree- ment. The following procedures apply:

(1) A claim for an award must be made by motion under Rule 54(d)(2), subject to the provisions of this subdivision (h), at a time the court sets. Notice of the motion must be served on all parties and, for motions by class counsel, directed to class members in a reasonable manner.

(2) A class member, or a party from whom payment is

sought, may object to the motion.

(3) The court may hold a hearing and must find the facts and

# state its legal conclusions under Rule 52(a).

(4) The court may refer issues related to the amount of the award to a special master or a magistrate judge, as provided in Rule 54(d)(2)(D).

# Rule 23.1. Derivative Actions

(a) PREREQUISITES. This rule applies when one or more share- holders or members of a corporation or an unincorporated associa- tion bring a derivative action to enforce a right that the corpora- tion or association may properly assert but has failed to enforce. The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of shareholders or members who are similarly situated in enforc- ing the right of the corporation or association.

(b) PLEADING REQUIREMENTS. The complaint must be verified and

# must:

(1) allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the time of the transaction complained of, or that the plain- tiff’s share or membership later devolved on it by operation of law;

(2) allege that the action is not a collusive one to confer ju-

risdiction that the court would otherwise lack; and

# (3) state with particularity:

(A) any effort by the plaintiff to obtain the desired ac- tion from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members; and

(B) the reasons for not obtaining the action or not mak-

ing the effort.

(c) SETTLEMENT, DISMISSAL, AND COMPROMISE. A derivative ac- tion may be settled, voluntarily dismissed, or compromised only

# Rule 23.2

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

with the court’s approval. Notice of a proposed settlement, vol- untary dismissal, or compromise must be given to shareholders or members in the manner that the court orders.

# Rule 23.2. Actions Relating to Unincorporated Associations

This rule applies to an action brought by or against the mem- bers of an unincorporated association as a class by naming certain members as representative parties. The action may be maintained only if it appears that those parties will fairly and adequately pro- tect the interests of the association and its members. In conduct- ing the action, the court may issue any appropriate orders cor- responding with those in Rule 23(d), and the procedure for settle- ment, voluntary dismissal, or compromise must correspond with the procedure in Rule 23(e).

# Rule 24. Intervention

(a) INTERVENTION OF RIGHT. On timely motion, the court must

permit anyone to intervene who:

(1) is given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal

# statute; or

(2) claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that dispos- ing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.

# (b) PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION.

(1) In General. On timely motion, the court may permit any-

one to intervene who:

(A) is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal

# statute; or

(B) has a claim or defense that shares with the main ac-

# tion a common question of law or fact.

(2) By a Government Officer or Agency. On timely motion, the court may permit a federal or state governmental officer or agency to intervene if a party’s claim or defense is based on: (A) a statute or executive order administered by the offi-

# cer or agency; or

# (B) any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement is-

sued or made under the statute or executive order.

(3) Delay or Prejudice. In exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.

(c) NOTICE AND PLEADING REQUIRED. A motion to intervene must be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5. The motion must state the grounds for intervention and be accompanied by a plead- ing that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 26

# Rule 25. Substitution of Parties

# (a) DEATH.

(1) Substitution if the Claim Is Not Extinguished. If a party dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may order substi- tution of the proper party. A motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the decedent’s successor or represent- ative. If the motion is not made within 90 days after service of a statement noting the death, the action by or against the decedent must be dismissed.

(2) Continuation Among the Remaining Parties. After a party’s death, if the right sought to be enforced survives only to or against the remaining parties, the action does not abate, but proceeds in favor of or against the remaining parties. The death should be noted on the record.

(3) Service. A motion to substitute, together with a notice of hearing, must be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5 and on nonparties as provided in Rule 4. A statement noting death must be served in the same manner. Service may be made in any judicial district.

(b) INCOMPETENCY. If a party becomes incompetent, the court may, on motion, permit the action to be continued by or against the party’s representative. The motion must be served as provided in Rule 25(a)(3).

(c) TRANSFER OF INTEREST. If an interest is transferred, the ac- tion may be continued by or against the original party unless the court, on motion, orders the transferee to be substituted in the ac- tion or joined with the original party. The motion must be served as provided in Rule 25(a)(3).

(d) PUBLIC OFFICERS; DEATH OR SEPARATION FROM OFFICE. An ac- tion does not abate when a public officer who is a party in an offi- cial capacity dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office while the action is pending. The officer’s successor is automatically sub- stituted as a party. Later proceedings should be in the substituted party’s name, but any misnomer not affecting the parties’ sub- stantial rights must be disregarded. The court may order substi- tution at any time, but the absence of such an order does not af- fect the substitution. (As amended Dec. 29, 1948, eff. Oct. 20, 1949; Apr. 17, 1961, eff.

# TITLE V. DISCLOSURES AND DISCOVERY

# Rule 26. Duty to Disclose; General Provisions Governing Discovery

(a) REQUIRED DISCLOSURES. (1) Initial Disclosure.

(A) In General. Except as exempted by Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or as otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party must, without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other parties:

(i) the name and, if known, the address and telephone number of each individual likely to have discoverable

# Rule 26

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

information—along with the subjects of that informa- tion—that the disclosing party may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;

(ii) a copy—or a description by category and loca- tion—of all documents, electronically stored informa- tion, and tangible things that the disclosing party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use to support its claims or defenses, unless the use would be solely for impeachment;

(iii) a computation of each category of damages claimed by the disclosing party—who must also make available for inspection and copying as under Rule 34 the documents or other evidentiary material, unless privileged or protected from disclosure, on which each computation is based, including materials bearing on the nature and extent of injuries suffered; and

(iv) for inspection and copying as under Rule 34, any insurance agreement under which an insurance busi- ness may be liable to satisfy all or part of a possible judgment in the action or to indemnify or reimburse for payments made to satisfy the judgment.

# (B) Proceedings Exempt from Initial Disclosure. The follow-

ing proceedings are exempt from initial disclosure:

(i) an action for review on an administrative record; (ii) a forfeiture action in rem arising from a federal

# statute;

(iii) a petition for habeas corpus or any other pro- ceeding to challenge a criminal conviction or sentence; (iv) an action brought without an attorney by a per- son in the custody of the United States, a state, or a state subdivision;

(v) an action to enforce or quash an administrative

# summons or subpoena;

(vi) an action by the United States to recover benefit

# payments;

(vii) an action by the United States to collect on a

student loan guaranteed by the United States;

(viii) a proceeding ancillary to a proceeding in an-

# other court; and

(ix) an action to enforce an arbitration award.

(C) Time for Initial Disclosures—In General. A party must make the initial disclosures at or within 14 days after the parties’ Rule 26(f) conference unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order, or unless a party objects during the conference that initial disclosures are not ap- propriate in this action and states the objection in the proposed discovery plan. In ruling on the objection, the court must determine what disclosures, if any, are to be made and must set the time for disclosure.

(D) Time for Initial Disclosures—For Parties Served or Joined Later. A party that is first served or otherwise joined after the Rule 26(f) conference must make the ini- tial disclosures within 30 days after being served or joined, unless a different time is set by stipulation or court order.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 26

(E) Basis for Initial Disclosure; Unacceptable Excuses. A party must make its initial disclosures based on the infor- mation then reasonably available to it. A party is not ex- cused from making its disclosures because it has not fully investigated the case or because it challenges the suffi- ciency of another party’s disclosures or because another party has not made its disclosures.

# (2) Disclosure of Expert Testimony.

(A) In General. In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1), a party must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evi- dence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.

(B) Witnesses Who Must Provide a Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, this disclo- sure must be accompanied by a written report—prepared and signed by the witness—if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party’s employee regularly in- volve giving expert testimony. The report must contain:

# (i) a complete statement of all opinions the witness

will express and the basis and reasons for them;

(ii) the facts or data considered by the witness in

forming them;

(iii) any exhibits that will be used to summarize or

support them;

(iv) the witness’s qualifications, including a list of

all publications authored in the previous 10 years;

(v) a list of all other cases in which, during the pre- vious 4 years, the witness testified as an expert at trial or by deposition; and

(vi) a statement of the compensation to be paid for

# the study and testimony in the case.

(C) Witnesses Who Do Not Provide a Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, if the witness is not required to provide a written report, this disclosure must state:

(i) the subject matter on which the witness is ex- pected to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evi- dence 702, 703, or 705; and

# (ii) a summary of the facts and opinions to which the

witness is expected to testify.

(D) Time to Disclose Expert Testimony. A party must make these disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court order, the dis- closures must be made:

the case to be ready for trial; or

(ii) if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) or (C), within 30 days after the other party’s disclosure.

(E) Supplementing the Disclosure. The parties must supple-

ment these disclosures when required under Rule 26(e).

# (3) Pretrial Disclosures.

# Rule 26

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(A) In General. In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1) and (2), a party must provide to the other par- ties and promptly file the following information about the evidence that it may present at trial other than solely for impeachment:

(i) the name and, if not previously provided, the ad- dress and telephone number of each witness—sepa- rately identifying those the party expects to present and those it may call if the need arises;

(ii) the designation of those witnesses whose testi- mony the party expects to present by deposition and, if not taken stenographically, a transcript of the perti- nent parts of the deposition; and

(iii) an identification of each document or other ex- hibit, including summaries of other evidence—sepa- rately identifying those items the party expects to offer and those it may offer if the need arises.

(B) Time for Pretrial Disclosures; Objections. Unless the court orders otherwise, these disclosures must be made at least 30 days before trial. Within 14 days after they are made, unless the court sets a different time, a party may serve and promptly file a list of the following objections: any objections to the use under Rule 32(a) of a deposition designated by another party under Rule 26(a)(3)(A)(ii); and any objection, together with the grounds for it, that may be made to the admissibility of materials identified under Rule 26(a)(3)(A)(iii). An objection not so made—except for one under Federal Rule of Evidence 402 or 403—is waived unless excused by the court for good cause.

(4) Form of Disclosures. Unless the court orders otherwise, all disclosures under Rule 26(a) must be in writing, signed, and served.

# (b) DISCOVERY SCOPE AND LIMITS.

(1) Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discov- ery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the impor- tance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.

# (2) Limitations on Frequency and Extent.

(A) When Permitted. By order, the court may alter the limits in these rules on the number of depositions and in- terrogatories or on the length of depositions under Rule 30. By order or local rule, the court may also limit the num- ber of requests under Rule 36.

(B) Specific Limitations on Electronically Stored Informa- tion. A party need not provide discovery of electronically stored information from sources that the party identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 26

order, the party from whom discovery is sought must show that the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limita- tions of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.

(C) When Required. On motion or on its own, the court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowed by these rules or by local rule if it determines that:

(i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;

(ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample oppor- tunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or

(iii) the proposed discovery is outside the scope per-

mitted by Rule 26(b)(1).

# (3) Trial Preparation: Materials.

(A) Documents and Tangible Things. Ordinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative (including the other party’s attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent). But, subject to Rule 26(b)(4), those materials may be discovered if:

(i) they are otherwise discoverable under Rule

(ii) the party shows that it has substantial need for the materials to prepare its case and cannot, without undue hardship, obtain their substantial equivalent by other means.

(B) Protection Against Disclosure. If the court orders dis- covery of those materials, it must protect against disclo- sure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party’s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.

(C) Previous Statement. Any party or other person may, on request and without the required showing, obtain the person’s own previous statement about the action or its subject matter. If the request is refused, the person may move for a court order, and Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of expenses. A previous statement is either:

(i) a written statement that the person has signed or

otherwise adopted or approved; or

(ii) a contemporaneous stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording—or a transcription of it—that recites substantially verbatim the person’s oral statement. (4) Trial Preparation: Experts.

(A) Deposition of an Expert Who May Testify. A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert whose opinions may be presented at trial. If Rule

# Rule 26

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

26(a)(2)(B) requires a report from the expert, the deposition may be conducted only after the report is provided.

(B) Trial-Preparation Protection for Draft Reports or Disclo- sures. Rules 26(b)(3)(A) and (B) protect drafts of any report or disclosure required under Rule 26(a)(2), regardless of the form in which the draft is recorded.

(C) Trial-Preparation Protection for Communications Be- tween a Party’s Attorney and Expert Witnesses. Rules 26(b)(3)(A) and (B) protect communications between the party’s attorney and any witness required to provide a re- port under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), regardless of the form of the communications, except to the extent that the commu- nications:

# (i) relate to compensation for the expert’s study or

# testimony;

(ii) identify facts or data that the party’s attorney provided and that the expert considered in forming the opinions to be expressed; or

(iii) identify assumptions that the party’s attorney provided and that the expert relied on in forming the opinions to be expressed.

(D) Expert Employed Only for Trial Preparation. Ordi- narily, a party may not, by interrogatories or deposition, discover facts known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or to prepare for trial and who is not expected to be called as a witness at trial. But a party may do so only:

(i) as provided in Rule 35(b); or (ii) on showing exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.

(E) Payment. Unless manifest injustice would result, the

court must require that the party seeking discovery:

(i) pay the expert a reasonable fee for time spent in responding to discovery under Rule 26(b)(4)(A) or (D); and

(ii) for discovery under (D), also pay the other party a fair portion of the fees and expenses it reasonably in- curred in obtaining the expert’s facts and opinions. (5) Claiming Privilege or Protecting Trial-Preparation Materials. (A) Information Withheld. When a party withholds infor- mation otherwise discoverable by claiming that the infor- mation is privileged or subject to protection as trial-prep- aration material, the party must:

(i) expressly make the claim; and (ii) describe the nature of the documents, commu- nications, or tangible things not produced or dis- closed—and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.

(B) Information Produced. If information produced in dis- covery is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the party making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 26

claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take rea- sonable steps to retrieve the information if the party dis- closed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determina- tion of the claim. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.

# (c) PROTECTIVE ORDERS.

(1) In General. A party or any person from whom discovery is sought may move for a protective order in the court where the action is pending—or as an alternative on matters relating to a deposition, in the court for the district where the deposi- tion will be taken. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with other affected parties in an effort to resolve the dispute without court action. The court may, for good cause, issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, in- cluding one or more of the following:

(A) forbidding the disclosure or discovery; (B) specifying terms, including time and place or the al-

# location of expenses, for the disclosure or discovery;

(C) prescribing a discovery method other than the one

selected by the party seeking discovery;

(D) forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting

# the scope of disclosure or discovery to certain matters;

(E) designating the persons who may be present while

the discovery is conducted;

(F) requiring that a deposition be sealed and opened only

# on court order;

(G) requiring that a trade secret or other confidential re- search, development, or commercial information not be re- vealed or be revealed only in a specified way; and

(H) requiring that the parties simultaneously file speci- fied documents or information in sealed envelopes, to be opened as the court directs.

(2) Ordering Discovery. If a motion for a protective order is wholly or partly denied, the court may, on just terms, order that any party or person provide or permit discovery.

(3) Awarding Expenses. Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award of

# expenses.

# (d) TIMING AND SEQUENCE OF DISCOVERY.

(1) Timing. A party may not seek discovery from any source before the parties have conferred as required by Rule 26(f), ex- cept in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B), or when authorized by these rules, by stipula- tion, or by court order.

# (2) Early Rule 34 Requests.

(A) Time to Deliver. More than 21 days after the summons and complaint are served on a party, a request under Rule 34 may be delivered:

party that has been served.

# Rule 26

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(B) When Considered Served. The request is considered to

have been served at the first Rule 26(f) conference.

(3) Sequence. Unless the parties stipulate or the court orders otherwise for the parties’ and witnesses’ convenience and in the interests of justice:

(A) methods of discovery may be used in any sequence;

# and

(B) discovery by one party does not require any other

party to delay its discovery.

# (e) SUPPLEMENTING DISCLOSURES AND RESPONSES.

(1) In General. A party who has made a disclosure under Rule 26(a)—or who has responded to an interrogatory, request for production, or request for admission—must supplement or cor- rect its disclosure or response:

(A) in a timely manner if the party learns that in some material respect the disclosure or response is incomplete or incorrect, and if the additional or corrective informa- tion has not otherwise been made known to the other par- ties during the discovery process or in writing; or

(B) as ordered by the court.

(2) Expert Witness. For an expert whose report must be dis- closed under Rule 26(a)(2)(B), the party’s duty to supplement extends both to information included in the report and to in- formation given during the expert’s deposition. Any additions or changes to this information must be disclosed by the time the party’s pretrial disclosures under Rule 26(a)(3) are due.

# (f) CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES; PLANNING FOR DISCOVERY.

(1) Conference Timing. Except in a proceeding exempted from initial disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1)(B) or when the court or- ders otherwise, the parties must confer as soon as prac- ticable—and in any event at least 21 days before a scheduling conference is to be held or a scheduling order is due under Rule 16(b).

(2) Conference Content; Parties’ Responsibilities. In conferring, the parties must consider the nature and basis of their claims and defenses and the possibilities for promptly settling or re- solving the case; make or arrange for the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1); discuss any issues about preserving discover- able information; and develop a proposed discovery plan. The attorneys of record and all unrepresented parties that have ap- peared in the case are jointly responsible for arranging the conference, for attempting in good faith to agree on the pro- posed discovery plan, and for submitting to the court within 14 days after the conference a written report outlining the plan. The court may order the parties or attorneys to attend the conference in person.

(3) Discovery Plan. A discovery plan must state the parties’

# views and proposals on:

(A) what changes should be made in the timing, form, or requirement for disclosures under Rule 26(a), including a statement of when initial disclosures were made or will be made;

(B) the subjects on which discovery may be needed, when discovery should be completed, and whether discovery should be conducted in phases or be limited to or focused on particular issues;

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 26

(C) any issues about disclosure, discovery, or preserva- tion of electronically stored information, including the form or forms in which it should be produced;

(D) any issues about claims of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation materials, including—if the parties agree on a procedure to assert these claims after produc- tion—whether to ask the court to include their agreement in an order under Federal Rule of Evidence 502;

(E) what changes should be made in the limitations on discovery imposed under these rules or by local rule, and what other limitations should be imposed; and

(F) any other orders that the court should issue under

# Rule 26(c) or under Rule 16(b) and (c).

(4) Expedited Schedule. If necessary to comply with its expe- dited schedule for Rule 16(b) conferences, a court may by local rule:

(A) require the parties’ conference to occur less than 21 days before the scheduling conference is held or a schedul- ing order is due under Rule 16(b); and

(B) require the written report outlining the discovery plan to be filed less than 14 days after the parties’ con- ference, or excuse the parties from submitting a written report and permit them to report orally on their discovery plan at the Rule 16(b) conference.

(1) Signature Required; Effect of Signature. Every disclosure under Rule 26(a)(1) or (a)(3) and every discovery request, re- sponse, or objection must be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney’s own name—or by the party person- ally, if unrepresented—and must state the signer’s address, e- mail address, and telephone number. By signing, an attorney or party certifies that to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry:

(A) with respect to a disclosure, it is complete and cor-

rect as of the time it is made; and

# (B) with respect to a discovery request, response, or ob-

jection, it is:

(i) consistent with these rules and warranted by ex- isting law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extend- ing, modifying, or reversing existing law, or for estab- lishing new law;

(ii) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly in- crease the cost of litigation; and

(iii) neither unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the case, prior dis- covery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the action.

(2) Failure to Sign. Other parties have no duty to act on an unsigned disclosure, request, response, or objection until it is signed, and the court must strike it unless a signature is promptly supplied after the omission is called to the attor- ney’s or party’s attention.

(3) Sanction for Improper Certification. If a certification vio- lates this rule without substantial justification, the court, on

# Rule 27

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

motion or on its own, must impose an appropriate sanction on the signer, the party on whose behalf the signer was acting, or both. The sanction may include an order to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the violation. (As amended Dec. 27, 1946, eff. Mar. 19, 1948; Jan. 21, 1963, eff.

# Rule 27. Depositions to Perpetuate Testimony

# (a) BEFORE AN ACTION IS FILED.

(1) Petition. A person who wants to perpetuate testimony about any matter cognizable in a United States court may file a verified petition in the district court for the district where any expected adverse party resides. The petition must ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to depose the named per- sons in order to perpetuate their testimony. The petition must be titled in the petitioner’s name and must show:

(A) that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action cognizable in a United States court but cannot presently bring it or cause it to be brought;

(B) the subject matter of the expected action and the pe-

titioner’s interest;

(C) the facts that the petitioner wants to establish by the proposed testimony and the reasons to perpetuate it; (D) the names or a description of the persons whom the petitioner expects to be adverse parties and their address- es, so far as known; and

(E) the name, address, and expected substance of the tes-

# timony of each deponent.

(2) Notice and Service. At least 21 days before the hearing date, the petitioner must serve each expected adverse party with a copy of the petition and a notice stating the time and place of the hearing. The notice may be served either inside or outside the district or state in the manner provided in Rule 4. If that service cannot be made with reasonable diligence on an expected adverse party, the court may order service by publi- cation or otherwise. The court must appoint an attorney to represent persons not served in the manner provided in Rule 4 and to cross-examine the deponent if an unserved person is not otherwise represented. If any expected adverse party is a minor or is incompetent, Rule 17(c) applies.

(3) Order and Examination. If satisfied that perpetuating the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the court must issue an order that designates or describes the persons whose depositions may be taken, specifies the subject matter of the examinations, and states whether the depositions will be taken orally or by written interrogatories. The depositions may then be taken under these rules, and the court may issue orders like those authorized by Rules 34 and 35. A reference in these rules to the court where an action is pending means, for purposes of this rule, the court where the petition for the dep- osition was filed.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 28

(4) Using the Deposition. A deposition to perpetuate testi- mony may be used under Rule 32(a) in any later-filed district- court action involving the same subject matter if the deposi- tion either was taken under these rules or, although not so taken, would be admissible in evidence in the courts of the state where it was taken.

# (b) PENDING APPEAL.

(1) In General. The court where a judgment has been rendered may, if an appeal has been taken or may still be taken, permit a party to depose witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further proceedings in that court.

(2) Motion. The party who wants to perpetuate testimony may move for leave to take the depositions, on the same no- tice and service as if the action were pending in the district court. The motion must show:

(A) the name, address, and expected substance of the tes-

# timony of each deponent; and

(B) the reasons for perpetuating the testimony.

(3) Court Order. If the court finds that perpetuating the testi- mony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, the court may permit the depositions to be taken and may issue orders like those authorized by Rules 34 and 35. The depositions may be taken and used as any other deposition taken in a pending dis- trict-court action.

(c) PERPETUATION BY AN ACTION. This rule does not limit a

court’s power to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony.

# Rule 28. Persons Before Whom Depositions May Be Taken

# (a) WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.

(1) In General. Within the United States or a territory or in- sular possession subject to United States jurisdiction, a depo- sition must be taken before:

(A) an officer authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or (B) a person appointed by the court where the action is

pending to administer oaths and take testimony.

(2) Definition of ‘‘Officer.’’ The term ‘‘officer’’ in Rules 30, 31, and 32 includes a person appointed by the court under this rule or designated by the parties under Rule 29(a).

# (b) IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY.

(1) In General. A deposition may be taken in a foreign coun-

# try:

(A) under an applicable treaty or convention; (B) under a letter of request, whether or not captioned a

# ‘‘letter rogatory’’;

(C) on notice, before a person authorized to administer oaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of ex- amination; or

(D) before a person commissioned by the court to admin-

ister any necessary oath and take testimony.

# Rule 29

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(2) Issuing a Letter of Request or a Commission. A letter of re-

quest, a commission, or both may be issued:

# (A) on appropriate terms after an application and notice

# of it; and

(B) without a showing that taking the deposition in an-

other manner is impracticable or inconvenient.

(3) Form of a Request, Notice, or Commission. When a letter of request or any other device is used according to a treaty or convention, it must be captioned in the form prescribed by that treaty or convention. A letter of request may be ad- dressed ‘‘To the Appropriate Authority in [name of country].’’ A deposition notice or a commission must designate by name or descriptive title the person before whom the deposition is to be taken.

(4) Letter of Request—Admitting Evidence. Evidence obtained in response to a letter of request need not be excluded merely because it is not a verbatim transcript, because the testimony was not taken under oath, or because of any similar departure from the requirements for depositions taken within the United States.

(c) DISQUALIFICATION. A deposition must not be taken before a person who is any party’s relative, employee, or attorney; who is related to or employed by any party’s attorney; or who is finan- cially interested in the action.

# Rule 29. Stipulations About Discovery Procedure

Unless the court orders otherwise, the parties may stipulate

# that:

(a) a deposition may be taken before any person, at any time or place, on any notice, and in the manner specified—in which event it may be used in the same way as any other deposition; and

(b) other procedures governing or limiting discovery be modi- fied—but a stipulation extending the time for any form of discov- ery must have court approval if it would interfere with the time set for completing discovery, for hearing a motion, or for trial.

(1) Without Leave. A party may, by oral questions, depose any person, including a party, without leave of court except as provided in Rule 30(a)(2). The deponent’s attendance may be compelled by subpoena under Rule 45.

(2) With Leave. A party must obtain leave of court, and the court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2):

(A) if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition

# and:

(i) the deposition would result in more than 10 depo- sitions being taken under this rule or Rule 31 by the

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 30

# plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by the third-party defendants;

(ii) the deponent has already been deposed in the

# case; or

(iii) the party seeks to take the deposition before the time specified in Rule 26(d), unless the party certifies in the notice, with supporting facts, that the deponent is expected to leave the United States and be unavail- able for examination in this country after that time; or

(B) if the deponent is confined in prison.

# (b) NOTICE OF THE DEPOSITION; OTHER FORMAL REQUIREMENTS.

(1) Notice in General. A party who wants to depose a person by oral questions must give reasonable written notice to every other party. The notice must state the time and place of the deposition and, if known, the deponent’s name and address. If the name is unknown, the notice must provide a general de- scription sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs.

(2) Producing Documents. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on the deponent, the materials designated for produc- tion, as set out in the subpoena, must be listed in the notice or in an attachment. The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a request under Rule 34 to produce documents and tangible things at the deposition.

# (3) Method of Recording.

(A) Method Stated in the Notice. The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for record- ing the testimony. Unless the court orders otherwise, tes- timony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or steno- graphic means. The noticing party bears the recording costs. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition. (B) Additional Method. With prior notice to the deponent and other parties, any party may designate another meth- od for recording the testimony in addition to that speci- fied in the original notice. That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the court orders otherwise.

(4) By Remote Means. The parties may stipulate—or the court may on motion order—that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of this rule and Rules 28(a), 37(a)(2), and 37(b)(1), the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.

# (5) Officer’s Duties.

(A) Before the Deposition. Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, a deposition must be conducted before an offi- cer appointed or designated under Rule 28. The officer must begin the deposition with an on-the-record statement that includes:

(i) the officer’s name and business address; (ii) the date, time, and place of the deposition; (iii) the deponent’s name; (iv) the officer’s administration of the oath or affir-

# mation to the deponent; and

(v) the identity of all persons present.

# Rule 30

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(B) Conducting the Deposition; Avoiding Distortion. If the deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the officer must repeat the items in Rule 30(b)(5)(A)(i)–(iii) at the be- ginning of each unit of the recording medium. The depo- nent’s and attorneys’ appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through recording techniques.

(C) After the Deposition. At the end of a deposition, the of- ficer must state on the record that the deposition is com- plete and must set out any stipulations made by the attor- neys about custody of the transcript or recording and of the exhibits, or about any other pertinent matters.

(6) Notice or Subpoena Directed to an Organization. In its no- tice or subpoena, a party may name as the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, a gov- ernmental agency, or other entity and must describe with rea- sonable particularity the matters for examination. The named organization must designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or designate other persons who consent to testify on its behalf; and it may set out the matters on which each person designated will testify. Before or promptly after the notice or subpoena is served, the serving party and the or- ganization must confer in good faith about the matters for ex- amination. A subpoena must advise a nonparty organization of its duty to confer with the serving party and to designate each person who will testify. The persons designated must testify about information known or reasonably available to the orga- nization. This paragraph (6) does not preclude a deposition by any other procedure allowed by these rules.

# (c) EXAMINATION AND CROSS-EXAMINATION; RECORD OF THE EXAM-

(1) Examination and Cross-Examination. The examination and cross-examination of a deponent proceed as they would at trial under the Federal Rules of Evidence, except Rules 103 and 615. After putting the deponent under oath or affirmation, the offi- cer must record the testimony by the method designated under Rule 30(b)(3)(A). The testimony must be recorded by the officer personally or by a person acting in the presence and under the direction of the officer.

(2) Objections. An objection at the time of the examination— whether to evidence, to a party’s conduct, to the officer’s qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition—must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when nec- essary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d)(3).

(3) Participating Through Written Questions. Instead of partici- pating in the oral examination, a party may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party noticing the depo- sition, who must deliver them to the officer. The officer must ask the deponent those questions and record the answers ver- batim.

# (d) DURATION; SANCTION; MOTION TO TERMINATE OR LIMIT.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 30

(1) Duration. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a deposition is limited to one day of 7 hours. The court must allow additional time consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2) if needed to fairly examine the deponent or if the deponent, another person, or any other circumstance impedes or delays the examination.

(2) Sanction. The court may impose an appropriate sanc- tion—including the reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees in- curred by any party—on a person who impedes, delays, or frus- trates the fair examination of the deponent.

# (3) Motion to Terminate or Limit.

(A) Grounds. At any time during a deposition, the depo- nent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a man- ner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. The motion may be filed in the court where the action is pending or the deposition is being taken. If the objecting deponent or party so de- mands, the deposition must be suspended for the time nec- essary to obtain an order.

(B) Order. The court may order that the deposition be terminated or may limit its scope and manner as provided in Rule 26(c). If terminated, the deposition may be re- sumed only by order of the court where the action is pend- ing.

(C) Award of Expenses. Rule 37(a)(5) applies to the award

# of expenses.

# (e) REVIEW BY THE WITNESS; CHANGES.

(1) Review; Statement of Changes. On request by the deponent or a party before the deposition is completed, the deponent must be allowed 30 days after being notified by the officer that the transcript or recording is available in which:

(A) to review the transcript or recording; and (B) if there are changes in form or substance, to sign a statement listing the changes and the reasons for making them.

(2) Changes Indicated in the Officer’s Certificate. The officer must note in the certificate prescribed by Rule 30(f)(1) whether a review was requested and, if so, must attach any changes the deponent makes during the 30-day period.

# (f) CERTIFICATION AND DELIVERY; EXHIBITS; COPIES OF THE TRAN-

(1) Certification and Delivery. The officer must certify in writ- ing that the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition accurately records the witness’s testimony. The certificate must accompany the record of the deposition. Unless the court orders otherwise, the officer must seal the deposition in an en- velope or package bearing the title of the action and marked ‘‘Deposition of [witness’s name]’’ and must promptly send it to the attorney who arranged for the transcript or recording. The attorney must store it under conditions that will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration.

# (2) Documents and Tangible Things.

(A) Originals and Copies. Documents and tangible things produced for inspection during a deposition must, on a par- ty’s request, be marked for identification and attached to

# Rule 31

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

the deposition. Any party may inspect and copy them. But if the person who produced them wants to keep the origi- nals, the person may:

(i) offer copies to be marked, attached to the deposi- tion, and then used as originals—after giving all par- ties a fair opportunity to verify the copies by compar- ing them with the originals; or

(ii) give all parties a fair opportunity to inspect and copy the originals after they are marked—in which event the originals may be used as if attached to the deposition.

(B) Order Regarding the Originals. Any party may move for an order that the originals be attached to the deposi- tion pending final disposition of the case.

(3) Copies of the Transcript or Recording. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, the officer must retain the stenographic notes of a deposition taken stenographically or a copy of the recording of a deposition taken by another meth- od. When paid reasonable charges, the officer must furnish a copy of the transcript or recording to any party or the depo- nent.

(4) Notice of Filing. A party who files the deposition must

# promptly notify all other parties of the filing.

(g) FAILURE TO ATTEND A DEPOSITION OR SERVE A SUBPOENA; EX- PENSES. A party who, expecting a deposition to be taken, attends in person or by an attorney may recover reasonable expenses for attending, including attorney’s fees, if the noticing party failed to:

(1) attend and proceed with the deposition; or (2) serve a subpoena on a nonparty deponent, who con-

sequently did not attend.

(1) Without Leave. A party may, by written questions, depose any person, including a party, without leave of court except as provided in Rule 31(a)(2). The deponent’s attendance may be compelled by subpoena under Rule 45.

(2) With Leave. A party must obtain leave of court, and the court must grant leave to the extent consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2):

(A) if the parties have not stipulated to the deposition

# and:

(i) the deposition would result in more than 10 depo- sitions being taken under this rule or Rule 30 by the plaintiffs, or by the defendants, or by the third-party defendants;

(ii) the deponent has already been deposed in the

# case; or

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 32

(iii) the party seeks to take a deposition before the

time specified in Rule 26(d); or

(B) if the deponent is confined in prison.

(3) Service; Required Notice. A party who wants to depose a person by written questions must serve them on every other party, with a notice stating, if known, the deponent’s name and address. If the name is unknown, the notice must provide a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs. The no- tice must also state the name or descriptive title and the ad- dress of the officer before whom the deposition will be taken. (4) Questions Directed to an Organization. A public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental agency may be deposed by written questions in accordance with Rule 30(b)(6).

(5) Questions from Other Parties. Any questions to the depo- nent from other parties must be served on all parties as fol- lows: cross-questions, within 14 days after being served with the notice and direct questions; redirect questions, within 7 days after being served with cross-questions; and recross-ques- tions, within 7 days after being served with redirect questions. The court may, for good cause, extend or shorten these times. (b) DELIVERY TO THE OFFICER; OFFICER’S DUTIES. The party who noticed the deposition must deliver to the officer a copy of all the questions served and of the notice. The officer must promptly pro- ceed in the manner provided in Rule 30(c), (e), and (f) to:

(1) take the deponent’s testimony in response to the ques-

# tions;

(2) prepare and certify the deposition; and (3) send it to the party, attaching a copy of the questions

# and of the notice.

# (c) NOTICE OF COMPLETION OR FILING.

(1) Completion. The party who noticed the deposition must

notify all other parties when it is completed.

(2) Filing. A party who files the deposition must promptly

# notify all other parties of the filing.

# Rule 32. Using Depositions in Court Proceedings

# (a) USING DEPOSITIONS.

(1) In General. At a hearing or trial, all or part of a deposi-

tion may be used against a party on these conditions:

(A) the party was present or represented at the taking of

the deposition or had reasonable notice of it;

(B) it is used to the extent it would be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence if the deponent were present and testifying; and

(C) the use is allowed by Rule 32(a)(2) through (8).

(2) Impeachment and Other Uses. Any party may use a deposi- tion to contradict or impeach the testimony given by the de- ponent as a witness, or for any other purpose allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.

# Rule 32

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(3) Deposition of Party, Agent, or Designee. An adverse party may use for any purpose the deposition of a party or anyone who, when deposed, was the party’s officer, director, managing agent, or designee under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4).

(4) Unavailable Witness. A party may use for any purpose the deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, if the court finds:

(A) that the witness is dead; (B) that the witness is more than 100 miles from the place of hearing or trial or is outside the United States, unless it appears that the witness’s absence was procured by the party offering the deposition;

(C) that the witness cannot attend or testify because of

# age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;

(D) that the party offering the deposition could not pro-

# cure the witness’s attendance by subpoena; or

(E) on motion and notice, that exceptional circum- stances make it desirable—in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of live testimony in open court—to permit the deposition to be used.

# (5) Limitations on Use.

(A) Deposition Taken on Short Notice. A deposition must not be used against a party who, having received less than 14 days’ notice of the deposition, promptly moved for a protective order under Rule 26(c)(1)(B) requesting that it not be taken or be taken at a different time or place—and this motion was still pending when the deposition was taken.

(B) Unavailable Deponent; Party Could Not Obtain an At- torney. A deposition taken without leave of court under the unavailability provision of Rule 30(a)(2)(A)(iii) must not be used against a party who shows that, when served with the notice, it could not, despite diligent efforts, ob- tain an attorney to represent it at the deposition.

(6) Using Part of a Deposition. If a party offers in evidence only part of a deposition, an adverse party may require the of- feror to introduce other parts that in fairness should be con- sidered with the part introduced, and any party may itself in- troduce any other parts.

(7) Substituting a Party. Substituting a party under Rule 25 does not affect the right to use a deposition previously taken. (8) Deposition Taken in an Earlier Action. A deposition law- fully taken and, if required, filed in any federal- or state-court action may be used in a later action involving the same sub- ject matter between the same parties, or their representatives or successors in interest, to the same extent as if taken in the later action. A deposition previously taken may also be used as allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.

(b) OBJECTIONS TO ADMISSIBILITY. Subject to Rules 28(b) and 32(d)(3), an objection may be made at a hearing or trial to the ad- mission of any deposition testimony that would be inadmissible if the witness were present and testifying.

(c) FORM OF PRESENTATION. Unless the court orders otherwise, a party must provide a transcript of any deposition testimony the

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 33

party offers, but may provide the court with the testimony in non- transcript form as well. On any party’s request, deposition testi- mony offered in a jury trial for any purpose other than impeach- ment must be presented in nontranscript form, if available, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.

# (d) WAIVER OF OBJECTIONS.

(1) To the Notice. An objection to an error or irregularity in a deposition notice is waived unless promptly served in writ- ing on the party giving the notice.

(2) To the Officer’s Qualification. An objection based on dis- qualification of the officer before whom a deposition is to be taken is waived if not made:

(A) before the deposition begins; or (B) promptly after the basis for disqualification becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.

# (3) To the Taking of the Deposition.

(A) Objection to Competence, Relevance, or Materiality. An objection to a deponent’s competence—or to the com- petence, relevance, or materiality of testimony—is not waived by a failure to make the objection before or during the deposition, unless the ground for it might have been corrected at that time.

(B) Objection to an Error or Irregularity. An objection to an error or irregularity at an oral examination is waived if:

(i) it relates to the manner of taking the deposition, the form of a question or answer, the oath or affirma- tion, a party’s conduct, or other matters that might have been corrected at that time; and

(ii) it is not timely made during the deposition.

(C) Objection to a Written Question. An objection to the form of a written question under Rule 31 is waived if not served in writing on the party submitting the question within the time for serving responsive questions or, if the question is a recross-question, within 7 days after being served with it.

(4) To Completing and Returning the Deposition. An objection to how the officer transcribed the testimony—or prepared, signed, certified, sealed, endorsed, sent, or otherwise dealt with the deposition—is waived unless a motion to suppress is made promptly after the error or irregularity becomes known or, with reasonable diligence, could have been known.

# Rule 33. Interrogatories to Parties

# (a) IN GENERAL.

(1) Number. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 written interrogatories, including all discrete subparts. Leave to serve additional interrogatories may be granted to the ex- tent consistent with Rule 26(b)(1) and (2).

# Rule 34

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(2) Scope. An interrogatory may relate to any matter that may be inquired into under Rule 26(b). An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or conten- tion that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be an- swered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pre- trial conference or some other time.

# (b) ANSWERS AND OBJECTIONS.

(1) Responding Party. The interrogatories must be answered:

(A) by the party to whom they are directed; or (B) if that party is a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, or a governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who must furnish the information available to the party.

(2) Time to Respond. The responding party must serve its an- swers and any objections within 30 days after being served with the interrogatories. A shorter or longer time may be stip- ulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.

(3) Answering Each Interrogatory. Each interrogatory must, to the extent it is not objected to, be answered separately and fully in writing under oath.

(4) Objections. The grounds for objecting to an interrogatory must be stated with specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the court, for good cause, ex- cuses the failure.

(5) Signature. The person who makes the answers must sign them, and the attorney who objects must sign any objections. (c) USE. An answer to an interrogatory may be used to the ex-

tent allowed by the Federal Rules of Evidence.

(d) OPTION TO PRODUCE BUSINESS RECORDS. If the answer to an interrogatory may be determined by examining, auditing, compil- ing, abstracting, or summarizing a party’s business records (in- cluding electronically stored information), and if the burden of de- riving or ascertaining the answer will be substantially the same for either party, the responding party may answer by:

(1) specifying the records that must be reviewed, in suffi- cient detail to enable the interrogating party to locate and identify them as readily as the responding party could; and

(2) giving the interrogating party a reasonable opportunity to examine and audit the records and to make copies, compila- tions, abstracts, or summaries.

(a) IN GENERAL. A party may serve on any other party a request

# within the scope of Rule 26(b):

(1) to produce and permit the requesting party or its rep- resentative to inspect, copy, test, or sample the following items in the responding party’s possession, custody, or con- trol:

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 34

(A) any designated documents or electronically stored information—including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, sound recordings, images, and other data or data compilations—stored in any medium from which in- formation can be obtained either directly or, if necessary, after translation by the responding party into a reason- ably usable form; or

(B) any designated tangible things; or

(2) to permit entry onto designated land or other property possessed or controlled by the responding party, so that the requesting party may inspect, measure, survey, photograph, test, or sample the property or any designated object or oper- ation on it. (b) PROCEDURE.

# (1) Contents of the Request. The request:

(A) must describe with reasonable particularity each

item or category of items to be inspected;

(B) must specify a reasonable time, place, and manner for the inspection and for performing the related acts; and (C) may specify the form or forms in which electroni-

cally stored information is to be produced.

# (2) Responses and Objections.

(A) Time to Respond. The party to whom the request is di- rected must respond in writing within 30 days after being served or—if the request was delivered under Rule 26(d)(2)—within 30 days after the parties’ first Rule 26(f) conference. A shorter or longer time may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.

(B) Responding to Each Item. For each item or category, the response must either state that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested or state with specificity the grounds for objecting to the request, includ- ing the reasons. The responding party may state that it will produce copies of documents or of electronically stored information instead of permitting inspection. The production must then be completed no later than the time for inspection specified in the request or another reason- able time specified in the response.

(C) Objections. An objection must state whether any re- sponsive materials are being withheld on the basis of that objection. An objection to part of a request must specify the part and permit inspection of the rest.

(D) Responding to a Request for Production of Electronically Stored Information. The response may state an objection to a requested form for producing electronically stored infor- mation. If the responding party objects to a requested form—or if no form was specified in the request—the party must state the form or forms it intends to use.

(E) Producing the Documents or Electronically Stored Infor- mation. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, these procedures apply to producing documents or electronically stored information:

(i) A party must produce documents as they are kept in the usual course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the re- quest;

# Rule 35

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(ii) If a request does not specify a form for producing electronically stored information, a party must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms; and

(iii) A party need not produce the same electroni-

cally stored information in more than one form.

(c) NONPARTIES. As provided in Rule 45, a nonparty may be com- pelled to produce documents and tangible things or to permit an inspection.

# Rule 35. Physical and Mental Examinations

# (a) ORDER FOR AN EXAMINATION.

(1) In General. The court where the action is pending may order a party whose mental or physical condition—including blood group—is in controversy to submit to a physical or men- tal examination by a suitably licensed or certified examiner. The court has the same authority to order a party to produce for examination a person who is in its custody or under its legal control.

# (2) Motion and Notice; Contents of the Order. The order:

(A) may be made only on motion for good cause and on

notice to all parties and the person to be examined; and

(B) must specify the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the examination, as well as the person or persons who will perform it.

# (b) EXAMINER’S REPORT.

(1) Request by the Party or Person Examined. The party who moved for the examination must, on request, deliver to the re- quester a copy of the examiner’s report, together with like re- ports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. The request may be made by the party against whom the examina- tion order was issued or by the person examined.

(2) Contents. The examiner’s report must be in writing and must set out in detail the examiner’s findings, including diag- noses, conclusions, and the results of any tests.

(3) Request by the Moving Party. After delivering the reports, the party who moved for the examination may request—and is entitled to receive—from the party against whom the exam- ination order was issued like reports of all earlier or later ex- aminations of the same condition. But those reports need not be delivered by the party with custody or control of the person examined if the party shows that it could not obtain them.

(4) Waiver of Privilege. By requesting and obtaining the exam- iner’s report, or by deposing the examiner, the party examined waives any privilege it may have—in that action or any other action involving the same controversy—concerning testimony about all examinations of the same condition.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 36

(5) Failure to Deliver a Report. The court on motion may order—on just terms—that a party deliver the report of an ex- amination. If the report is not provided, the court may ex- clude the examiner’s testimony at trial.

(6) Scope. This subdivision (b) applies also to an examination made by the parties’ agreement, unless the agreement states otherwise. This subdivision does not preclude obtaining an ex- aminer’s report or deposing an examiner under other rules.

# Rule 36. Requests for Admission (a) SCOPE AND PROCEDURE.

(1) Scope. A party may serve on any other party a written re- quest to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) relating to:

# (A) facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions

# about either; and

# (B) the genuineness of any described documents.

(2) Form; Copy of a Document. Each matter must be sepa- rately stated. A request to admit the genuineness of a docu- ment must be accompanied by a copy of the document unless it is, or has been, otherwise furnished or made available for in- spection and copying.

(3) Time to Respond; Effect of Not Responding. A matter is ad- mitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney. A shorter or longer time for responding may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be or- dered by the court.

(4) Answer. If a matter is not admitted, the answer must spe- cifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly re- spond to the substance of the matter; and when good faith re- quires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the answer must specify the part admitted and qual- ify or deny the rest. The answering party may assert lack of knowledge or information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the party states that it has made reasonable in- quiry and that the information it knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to enable it to admit or deny.

(5) Objections. The grounds for objecting to a request must be stated. A party must not object solely on the ground that the request presents a genuine issue for trial.

(6) Motion Regarding the Sufficiency of an Answer or Objection. The requesting party may move to determine the sufficiency of an answer or objection. Unless the court finds an objection justified, it must order that an answer be served. On finding that an answer does not comply with this rule, the court may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The court may defer its final decision until

# Rule 37

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

a pretrial conference or a specified time before trial. Rule 37(a)(5) applies to an award of expenses.

(b) EFFECT OF AN ADMISSION; WITHDRAWING OR AMENDING IT. A matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended. Subject to Rule 16(e), the court may permit withdrawal or amendment if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the action and if the court is not persuaded that it would preju- dice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on the merits. An admission under this rule is not an admission for any other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other proceeding.

# Rule 37. Failure to Make Disclosures or to Cooperate in Discovery;

# Sanctions

(a) MOTION FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING DISCLOSURE OR DISCOVERY. (1) In General. On notice to other parties and all affected per- sons, a party may move for an order compelling disclosure or discovery. The motion must include a certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the person or party failing to make disclosure or discov- ery in an effort to obtain it without court action.

(2) Appropriate Court. A motion for an order to a party must be made in the court where the action is pending. A motion for an order to a nonparty must be made in the court where the discovery is or will be taken.

# (3) Specific Motions.

(A) To Compel Disclosure. If a party fails to make a disclo- sure required by Rule 26(a), any other party may move to compel disclosure and for appropriate sanctions.

(B) To Compel a Discovery Response. A party seeking dis- covery may move for an order compelling an answer, des- ignation, production, or inspection. This motion may be made if:

(i) a deponent fails to answer a question asked under

# Rule 30 or 31;

(ii) a corporation or other entity fails to make a des-

# ignation under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4);

(iii) a party fails to answer an interrogatory submit-

ted under Rule 33; or

(iv) a party fails to produce documents or fails to re- spond that inspection will be permitted—or fails to permit inspection—as requested under Rule 34.

(C) Related to a Deposition. When taking an oral deposi- tion, the party asking a question may complete or adjourn the examination before moving for an order.

(4) Evasive or Incomplete Disclosure, Answer, or Response. For purposes of this subdivision (a), an evasive or incomplete dis- closure, answer, or response must be treated as a failure to disclose, answer, or respond.

# (5) Payment of Expenses; Protective Orders.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 37

(A) If the Motion Is Granted (or Disclosure or Discovery Is Provided After Filing). If the motion is granted—or if the disclosure or requested discovery is provided after the mo- tion was filed—the court must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion, the party or attorney advising that conduct, or both to pay the movant’s reasonable ex- penses incurred in making the motion, including attor- ney’s fees. But the court must not order this payment if: (i) the movant filed the motion before attempting in good faith to obtain the disclosure or discovery with- out court action;

(ii) the opposing party’s nondisclosure, response, or

objection was substantially justified; or

(iii) other circumstances make an award of expenses

# unjust.

(B) If the Motion Is Denied. If the motion is denied, the court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and must, after giving an opportunity to be heard, require the movant, the attorney filing the motion, or both to pay the party or deponent who opposed the mo- tion its reasonable expenses incurred in opposing the mo- tion, including attorney’s fees. But the court must not order this payment if the motion was substantially justi- fied or other circumstances make an award of expenses un- just.

(C) If the Motion Is Granted in Part and Denied in Part. If the motion is granted in part and denied in part, the court may issue any protective order authorized under Rule 26(c) and may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, appor- tion the reasonable expenses for the motion.

# (b) FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH A COURT ORDER.

(1) Sanctions Sought in the District Where the Deposition Is Taken. If the court where the discovery is taken orders a depo- nent to be sworn or to answer a question and the deponent fails to obey, the failure may be treated as contempt of court. If a deposition-related motion is transferred to the court where the action is pending, and that court orders a deponent to be sworn or to answer a question and the deponent fails to obey, the failure may be treated as contempt of either the court where the discovery is taken or the court where the ac- tion is pending.

(2) Sanctions Sought in the District Where the Action Is Pending. (A) For Not Obeying a Discovery Order. If a party or a par- ty’s officer, director, or managing agent—or a witness des- ignated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)—fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order under Rule 26(f), 35, or 37(a), the court where the action is pending may issue further just orders. They may include the following:

(i) directing that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing party claims;

# Rule 37

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from support- ing or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in evidence; (iii) striking pleadings in whole or in part; (iv) staying further proceedings until the order is

obeyed;

(v) dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in

# part;

(vi) rendering a default judgment against the disobe-

# dient party; or

(vii) treating as contempt of court the failure to obey any order except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.

(B) For Not Producing a Person for Examination. If a party fails to comply with an order under Rule 35(a) requiring it to produce another person for examination, the court may issue any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)–(vi), un- less the disobedient party shows that it cannot produce the other person.

(C) Payment of Expenses. Instead of or in addition to the orders above, the court must order the disobedient party, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the rea- sonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the failure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

(1) Failure to Disclose or Supplement. If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, un- less the failure was substantially justified or is harmless. In addition to or instead of this sanction, the court, on motion and after giving an opportunity to be heard:

# (A) may order payment of the reasonable expenses, in-

cluding attorney’s fees, caused by the failure;

(B) may inform the jury of the party’s failure; and (C) may impose other appropriate sanctions, including

any of the orders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)–(vi).

(2) Failure to Admit. If a party fails to admit what is re- quested under Rule 36 and if the requesting party later proves a document to be genuine or the matter true, the requesting party may move that the party who failed to admit pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred in making that proof. The court must so order unless:

(A) the request was held objectionable under Rule 36(a); (B) the admission sought was of no substantial impor-

# tance;

(C) the party failing to admit had a reasonable ground to

believe that it might prevail on the matter; or

(D) there was other good reason for the failure to admit. (d) PARTY’S FAILURE TO ATTEND ITS OWN DEPOSITION, SERVE AN- SWERS TO INTERROGATORIES, OR RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR INSPEC- TION.

# (1) In General.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 37

(A) Motion; Grounds for Sanctions. The court where the

action is pending may, on motion, order sanctions if:

(i) a party or a party’s officer, director, or managing agent—or a person designated under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a)(4)—fails, after being served with proper notice, to appear for that person’s deposition; or

(ii) a party, after being properly served with inter- rogatories under Rule 33 or a request for inspection under Rule 34, fails to serve its answers, objections, or written response.

(B) Certification. A motion for sanctions for failing to an- swer or respond must include a certification that the mov- ant has in good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party failing to act in an effort to obtain the answer or response without court action.

(2) Unacceptable Excuse for Failing to Act. A failure described in Rule 37(d)(1)(A) is not excused on the ground that the dis- covery sought was objectionable, unless the party failing to act has a pending motion for a protective order under Rule 26(c).

(3) Types of Sanctions. Sanctions may include any of the or- ders listed in Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(i)–(vi). Instead of or in addition to these sanctions, the court must require the party failing to act, the attorney advising that party, or both to pay the rea- sonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the fail- ure, unless the failure was substantially justified or other cir- cumstances make an award of expenses unjust.

(e) FAILURE TO PRESERVE ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION. If electronically stored information that should have been pre- served in the anticipation or conduct of litigation is lost because a party failed to take reasonable steps to preserve it, and it can- not be restored or replaced through additional discovery, the court:

(1) upon finding prejudice to another party from loss of the information, may order measures no greater than necessary to cure the prejudice; or

(2) only upon finding that the party acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information’s use in the litiga- tion may:

(A) presume that the lost information was unfavorable

# to the party;

(B) instruct the jury that it may or must presume the in-

formation was unfavorable to the party; or

(C) dismiss the action or enter a default judgment. (f) FAILURE TO PARTICIPATE IN FRAMING A DISCOVERY PLAN. If a party or its attorney fails to participate in good faith in develop- ing and submitting a proposed discovery plan as required by Rule 26(f), the court may, after giving an opportunity to be heard, re- quire that party or attorney to pay to any other party the reason- able expenses, including attorney’s fees, caused by the failure.

# Rule 38

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# TITLE VI. TRIALS

# Rule 38. Right to a Jury Trial; Demand

(a) RIGHT PRESERVED. The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution—or as provided by a federal statute—is preserved to the parties inviolate.

# demand a jury trial by:

(1) serving the other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a pleading—no later than 14 days after the last pleading directed to the issue is served; and

(2) filing the demand in accordance with Rule 5(d).

(c) SPECIFYING ISSUES. In its demand, a party may specify the is- sues that it wishes to have tried by a jury; otherwise, it is consid- ered to have demanded a jury trial on all the issues so triable. If the party has demanded a jury trial on only some issues, any other party may—within 14 days after being served with the de- mand or within a shorter time ordered by the court—serve a de- mand for a jury trial on any other or all factual issues triable by jury.

(d) WAIVER; WITHDRAWAL. A party waives a jury trial unless its demand is properly served and filed. A proper demand may be withdrawn only if the parties consent.

(e) ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME CLAIMS. These rules do not create a right to a jury trial on issues in a claim that is an admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h).

# Rule 39. Trial by Jury or by the Court

(a) WHEN A DEMAND IS MADE. When a jury trial has been de- manded under Rule 38, the action must be designated on the dock- et as a jury action. The trial on all issues so demanded must be by jury unless:

(1) the parties or their attorneys file a stipulation to a

# nonjury trial or so stipulate on the record; or

(2) the court, on motion or on its own, finds that on some or

all of those issues there is no federal right to a jury trial.

(b) WHEN NO DEMAND IS MADE. Issues on which a jury trial is not properly demanded are to be tried by the court. But the court may, on motion, order a jury trial on any issue for which a jury might have been demanded.

(c) ADVISORY JURY; JURY TRIAL BY CONSENT. In an action not tri-

able of right by a jury, the court, on motion or on its own: (1) may try any issue with an advisory jury; or (2) may, with the parties’ consent, try any issue by a jury whose verdict has the same effect as if a jury trial had been a matter of right, unless the action is against the United States and a federal statute provides for a nonjury trial.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 41

# Rule 40. Scheduling Cases for Trial

Each court must provide by rule for scheduling trials. The court must give priority to actions entitled to priority by a federal stat- ute. (As amended Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

Rule 41. Dismissal of Actions (a) VOLUNTARY DISMISSAL. (1) By the Plaintiff.

(A) Without a Court Order. Subject to Rules 23(e), 23.1(c), 23.2, and 66 and any applicable federal statute, the plaintiff may dismiss an action without a court order by filing:

(i) a notice of dismissal before the opposing party serves either an answer or a motion for summary judg- ment; or

(ii) a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties

who have appeared.

(B) Effect. Unless the notice or stipulation states other- wise, the dismissal is without prejudice. But if the plain- tiff previously dismissed any federal- or state-court action based on or including the same claim, a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits.

(2) By Court Order; Effect. Except as provided in Rule 41(a)(1), an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff’s request only by court order, on terms that the court considers proper. If a de- fendant has pleaded a counterclaim before being served with the plaintiff’s motion to dismiss, the action may be dismissed over the defendant’s objection only if the counterclaim can re- main pending for independent adjudication. Unless the order states otherwise, a dismissal under this paragraph (2) is with- out prejudice.

(b) INVOLUNTARY DISMISSAL; EFFECT. If the plaintiff fails to pros- ecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss the action or any claim against it. Unless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this sub- division (b) and any dismissal not under this rule—except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19—operates as an adjudication on the merits.

(c) DISMISSING A COUNTERCLAIM, CROSSCLAIM, OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM. This rule applies to a dismissal of any counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim. A claimant’s voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) must be made:

(1) before a responsive pleading is served; or (2) if there is no responsive pleading, before evidence is in-

troduced at a hearing or trial.

(d) COSTS OF A PREVIOUSLY DISMISSED ACTION. If a plaintiff who previously dismissed an action in any court files an action based on or including the same claim against the same defendant, the court:

(1) may order the plaintiff to pay all or part of the costs of

# that previous action; and

(2) may stay the proceedings until the plaintiff has com-

plied.

# Rule 42

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 42. Consolidation; Separate Trials

(a) CONSOLIDATION. If actions before the court involve a common

# question of law or fact, the court may:

(1) join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the

# actions;

(2) consolidate the actions; or (3) issue any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay. (b) SEPARATE TRIALS. For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and economize, the court may order a separate trial of one or more separate issues, claims, crossclaims, counterclaims, or third-party claims. When ordering a separate trial, the court must preserve any federal right to a jury trial.

# Rule 43. Taking Testimony

(a) IN OPEN COURT. At trial, the witnesses’ testimony must be taken in open court unless a federal statute, the Federal Rules of Evidence, these rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court provide otherwise. For good cause in compelling circum- stances and with appropriate safeguards, the court may permit testimony in open court by contemporaneous transmission from a different location.

(b) AFFIRMATION INSTEAD OF AN OATH. When these rules require

# an oath, a solemn affirmation suffices.

(c) EVIDENCE ON A MOTION. When a motion relies on facts outside the record, the court may hear the matter on affidavits or may hear it wholly or partly on oral testimony or on depositions.

(d) INTERPRETER. The court may appoint an interpreter of its choosing; fix reasonable compensation to be paid from funds pro- vided by law or by one or more parties; and tax the compensation as costs.

# Rule 44. Proving an Official Record

# (a) MEANS OF PROVING.

(1) Domestic Record. Each of the following evidences an offi- cial record—or an entry in it—that is otherwise admissible and is kept within the United States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States:

(A) an official publication of the record; or (B) a copy attested by the officer with legal custody of the record—or by the officer’s deputy—and accompanied by a certificate that the officer has custody. The certifi- cate must be made under seal:

political subdivision where the record is kept; or

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 45

(ii) by any public officer with a seal of office and with official duties in the district or political subdivi- sion where the record is kept.

# (2) Foreign Record.

(A) In General. Each of the following evidences a foreign official record—or an entry in it—that is otherwise admis- sible:

(i) an official publication of the record; or (ii) the record—or a copy—that is attested by an au- thorized person and is accompanied either by a final certification of genuineness or by a certification under a treaty or convention to which the United States and the country where the record is located are parties.

(B) Final Certification of Genuineness. A final certification must certify the genuineness of the signature and official position of the attester or of any foreign official whose certificate of genuineness relates to the attestation or is in a chain of certificates of genuineness relating to the at- testation. A final certification may be made by a secretary of a United States embassy or legation; by a consul gen- eral, vice consul, or consular agent of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of the foreign coun- try assigned or accredited to the United States.

(C) Other Means of Proof. If all parties have had a reason- able opportunity to investigate a foreign record’s authen- ticity and accuracy, the court may, for good cause, either: (i) admit an attested copy without final certifi-

# cation; or

(ii) permit the record to be evidenced by an attested

summary with or without a final certification. (b) LACK OF A RECORD. A written statement that a diligent search of designated records revealed no record or entry of a speci- fied tenor is admissible as evidence that the records contain no such record or entry. For domestic records, the statement must be authenticated under Rule 44(a)(1). For foreign records, the state- ment must comply with (a)(2)(C)(ii).

(c) OTHER PROOF. A party may prove an official record—or an entry or lack of an entry in it—by any other method authorized by law. (As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 44.1. Determining Foreign Law

A party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign country’s law must give notice by a pleading or other writing. In determin- ing foreign law, the court may consider any relevant material or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The court’s de- termination must be treated as a ruling on a question of law. (As added Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; amended Nov. 20, 1972, eff. July 1, 1975; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 45. Subpoena (a) IN GENERAL.

# Rule 45

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# (1) Form and Contents.

(A) Requirements—In General. Every subpoena must:

(i) state the court from which it issued; (ii) state the title of the action and its civil-action

# number;

(iii) command each person to whom it is directed to do the following at a specified time and place: attend and testify; produce designated documents, electroni- cally stored information, or tangible things in that person’s possession, custody, or control; or permit the inspection of premises; and

(iv) set out the text of Rule 45(d) and (e).

(B) Command to Attend a Deposition—Notice of the Record- ing Method. A subpoena commanding attendance at a depo- sition must state the method for recording the testimony. (C) Combining or Separating a Command to Produce or to Permit Inspection; Specifying the Form for Electronically Stored Information. A command to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things or to permit the inspection of premises may be included in a subpoena commanding attendance at a deposition, hear- ing, or trial, or may be set out in a separate subpoena. A subpoena may specify the form or forms in which elec- tronically stored information is to be produced.

(D) Command to Produce; Included Obligations. A com- mand in a subpoena to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things requires the re- sponding person to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the materials.

(2) Issuing Court. A subpoena must issue from the court

where the action is pending.

(3) Issued by Whom. The clerk must issue a subpoena, signed but otherwise in blank, to a party who requests it. That party must complete it before service. An attorney also may issue and sign a subpoena if the attorney is authorized to practice in the issuing court.

(4) Notice to Other Parties Before Service. If the subpoena com- mands the production of documents, electronically stored in- formation, or tangible things or the inspection of premises be- fore trial, then before it is served on the person to whom it is directed, a notice and a copy of the subpoena must be served on each party.

# (b) SERVICE.

(1) By Whom and How; Tendering Fees. Any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a subpoena. Serv- ing a subpoena requires delivering a copy to the named person and, if the subpoena requires that person’s attendance, ten- dering the fees for 1 day’s attendance and the mileage allowed by law. Fees and mileage need not be tendered when the sub- poena issues on behalf of the United States or any of its offi- cers or agencies.

(2) Service in the United States. A subpoena may be served at

# any place within the United States.

(3) Service in a Foreign Country. 28 U.S.C. § 1783 governs issu- ing and serving a subpoena directed to a United States na- tional or resident who is in a foreign country.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 45

(4) Proof of Service. Proving service, when necessary, requires filing with the issuing court a statement showing the date and manner of service and the names of the persons served. The statement must be certified by the server.

# (c) PLACE OF COMPLIANCE.

(1) For a Trial, Hearing, or Deposition. A subpoena may com- mand a person to attend a trial, hearing, or deposition only as follows:

(A) within 100 miles of where the person resides, is em-

ployed, or regularly transacts business in person; or

(B) within the state where the person resides, is em- ployed, or regularly transacts business in person, if the person

(i) is a party or a party’s officer; or (ii) is commanded to attend a trial and would not

# incur substantial expense.

(2) For Other Discovery. A subpoena may command:

(A) production of documents, electronically stored infor- mation, or tangible things at a place within 100 miles of where the person resides, is employed, or regularly trans- acts business in person; and

(B) inspection of premises at the premises to be in-

spected.

# (d) PROTECTING A PERSON SUBJECT TO A SUBPOENA; ENFORCE-

(1) Avoiding Undue Burden or Expense; Sanctions. A party or attorney responsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid imposing undue burden or ex- pense on a person subject to the subpoena. The court for the district where compliance is required must enforce this duty and impose an appropriate sanction—which may include lost earnings and reasonable attorney’s fees—on a party or attor- ney who fails to comply.

# (2) Command to Produce Materials or Permit Inspection.

(A) Appearance Not Required. A person commanded to produce documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things, or to permit the inspection of premises, need not appear in person at the place of production or in- spection unless also commanded to appear for a deposition, hearing, or trial.

(B) Objections. A person commanded to produce docu- ments or tangible things or to permit inspection may serve on the party or attorney designated in the subpoena a written objection to inspecting, copying, testing, or sam- pling any or all of the materials or to inspecting the prem- ises—or to producing electronically stored information in the form or forms requested. The objection must be served before the earlier of the time specified for compliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served. If an objection is made, the following rules apply:

(i) At any time, on notice to the commanded person, the serving party may move the court for the district where compliance is required for an order compelling production or inspection.

(ii) These acts may be required only as directed in the order, and the order must protect a person who is

# Rule 45

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

neither a party nor a party’s officer from significant expense resulting from compliance.

# (3) Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena.

(A) When Required. On timely motion, the court for the district where compliance is required must quash or mod- ify a subpoena that:

(i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; (ii) requires a person to comply beyond the geo-

graphical limits specified in Rule 45(c);

(iii) requires disclosure of privileged or other pro-

# tected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or

(iv) subjects a person to undue burden.

(B) When Permitted. To protect a person subject to or af- fected by a subpoena, the court for the district where com- pliance is required may, on motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it requires:

(i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential re-

# search, development, or commercial information; or

(ii) disclosing an unretained expert’s opinion or in- formation that does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results from the expert’s study that was not requested by a party.

(C) Specifying Conditions as an Alternative. In the circum- stances described in Rule 45(d)(3)(B), the court may, in- stead of quashing or modifying a subpoena, order appear- ance or production under specified conditions if the serv- ing party:

(i) shows a substantial need for the testimony or ma- terial that cannot be otherwise met without undue hardship; and

(ii) ensures that the subpoenaed person will be rea-

# sonably compensated. (e) DUTIES IN RESPONDING TO A SUBPOENA.

(1) Producing Documents or Electronically Stored Information. These procedures apply to producing documents or electroni- cally stored information:

(A) Documents. A person responding to a subpoena to produce documents must produce them as they are kept in the ordinary course of business or must organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the demand.

(B) Form for Producing Electronically Stored Information Not Specified. If a subpoena does not specify a form for pro- ducing electronically stored information, the person re- sponding must produce it in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or in a reasonably usable form or forms.

(C) Electronically Stored Information Produced in Only One Form. The person responding need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form. (D) Inaccessible Electronically Stored Information. The per- son responding need not provide discovery of electroni- cally stored information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective order, the person responding must show that

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 46

the information is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order discovery from such sources if the requesting party shows good cause, considering the limita- tions of Rule 26(b)(2)(C). The court may specify conditions for the discovery.

# (2) Claiming Privilege or Protection.

(A) Information Withheld. A person withholding subpoe- naed information under a claim that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial-preparation material must:

(i) expressly make the claim; and (ii) describe the nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or pro- tected, will enable the parties to assess the claim.

(B) Information Produced. If information produced in re- sponse to a subpoena is subject to a claim of privilege or of protection as trial-preparation material, the person making the claim may notify any party that received the information of the claim and the basis for it. After being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or de- stroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is re- solved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the informa- tion if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information under seal to the court for the district where compliance is required for a deter- mination of the claim. The person who produced the infor- mation must preserve the information until the claim is resolved.

(f) TRANSFERRING A SUBPOENA-RELATED MOTION. When the court where compliance is required did not issue the subpoena, it may transfer a motion under this rule to the issuing court if the person subject to the subpoena consents or if the court finds exceptional circumstances. Then, if the attorney for a person subject to a sub- poena is authorized to practice in the court where the motion was made, the attorney may file papers and appear on the motion as an officer of the issuing court. To enforce its order, the issuing court may transfer the order to the court where the motion was made.

(g) CONTEMPT. The court for the district where compliance is re- quired—and also, after a motion is transferred, the issuing court— may hold in contempt a person who, having been served, fails without adequate excuse to obey the subpoena or an order related to it.

Aug. 1, 1985; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr. 25, 2005, eff. Dec. 1, 2005; Apr. 12, 2006, eff. Dec. 1, 2006; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Apr. 16, 2013, eff. Dec. 1, 2013.)

# Rule 46. Objecting to a Ruling or Order

A formal exception to a ruling or order is unnecessary. When the ruling or order is requested or made, a party need only state the

# Rule 47

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

action that it wants the court to take or objects to, along with the grounds for the request or objection. Failing to object does not prejudice a party who had no opportunity to do so when the ruling or order was made. (As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 47. Selecting Jurors

(a) EXAMINING JURORS. The court may permit the parties or their attorneys to examine prospective jurors or may itself do so. If the court examines the jurors, it must permit the parties or their attorneys to make any further inquiry it considers proper, or must itself ask any of their additional questions it considers proper.

(b) PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES. The court must allow the number

of peremptory challenges provided by 28 U.S.C. § 1870.

(c) EXCUSING A JUROR. During trial or deliberation, the court

may excuse a juror for good cause. (As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 48. Number of Jurors; Verdict; Polling

(a) NUMBER OF JURORS. A jury must begin with at least 6 and no more than 12 members, and each juror must participate in the ver- dict unless excused under Rule 47(c).

(b) VERDICT. Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the verdict must be unanimous and must be returned by a jury of at least 6 members.

(c) POLLING. After a verdict is returned but before the jury is discharged, the court must on a party’s request, or may on its own, poll the jurors individually. If the poll reveals a lack of una- nimity or lack of assent by the number of jurors that the parties stipulated to, the court may direct the jury to deliberate further or may order a new trial. (As amended Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

# Rule 49. Special Verdict; General Verdict and Questions

# (a) SPECIAL VERDICT.

(1) In General. The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding on each issue of fact. The court may do so by:

(A) submitting written questions susceptible of a cat-

# egorical or other brief answer;

(B) submitting written forms of the special findings that might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or

(C) using any other method that the court considers ap-

# propriate.

(2) Instructions. The court must give the instructions and ex- planations necessary to enable the jury to make its findings on each submitted issue.

(3) Issues Not Submitted. A party waives the right to a jury trial on any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or evidence

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 50

but not submitted to the jury unless, before the jury retires, the party demands its submission to the jury. If the party does not demand submission, the court may make a finding on the issue. If the court makes no finding, it is considered to have made a finding consistent with its judgment on the special verdict.

# (b) GENERAL VERDICT WITH ANSWERS TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS.

(1) In General. The court may submit to the jury forms for a general verdict, together with written questions on one or more issues of fact that the jury must decide. The court must give the instructions and explanations necessary to enable the jury to render a general verdict and answer the questions in writing, and must direct the jury to do both.

(2) Verdict and Answers Consistent. When the general verdict and the answers are consistent, the court must approve, for entry under Rule 58, an appropriate judgment on the verdict and answers.

(3) Answers Inconsistent with the Verdict. When the answers are consistent with each other but one or more is inconsistent with the general verdict, the court may:

(A) approve, for entry under Rule 58, an appropriate judgment according to the answers, notwithstanding the general verdict;

(B) direct the jury to further consider its answers and

# verdict; or

# (C) order a new trial.

(4) Answers Inconsistent with Each Other and the Verdict. When the answers are inconsistent with each other and one or more is also inconsistent with the general verdict, judgment must not be entered; instead, the court must direct the jury to fur- ther consider its answers and verdict, or must order a new trial.

# tion for a New Trial; Conditional Ruling

# (a) JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW.

(1) In General. If a party has been fully heard on an issue dur- ing a jury trial and the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may:

(A) resolve the issue against the party; and (B) grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue.

(2) Motion. A motion for judgment as a matter of law may be made at any time before the case is submitted to the jury. The motion must specify the judgment sought and the law and facts that entitle the movant to the judgment.

(b) RENEWING THE MOTION AFTER TRIAL; ALTERNATIVE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL. If the court does not grant a motion for judg- ment as a matter of law made under Rule 50(a), the court is con- sidered to have submitted the action to the jury subject to the

# Rule 51

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

court’s later deciding the legal questions raised by the motion. No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment—or if the motion addresses a jury issue not decided by a verdict, no later than 28 days after the jury was discharged—the movant may file a re- newed motion for judgment as a matter of law and may include an alternative or joint request for a new trial under Rule 59. In ruling on the renewed motion, the court may:

(1) allow judgment on the verdict, if the jury returned a ver-

# dict;

(2) order a new trial; or (3) direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law.

# (c) GRANTING THE RENEWED MOTION; CONDITIONAL RULING ON A

(1) In General. If the court grants a renewed motion for judg- ment as a matter of law, it must also conditionally rule on any motion for a new trial by determining whether a new trial should be granted if the judgment is later vacated or reversed. The court must state the grounds for conditionally granting or denying the motion for a new trial.

(2) Effect of a Conditional Ruling. Conditionally granting the motion for a new trial does not affect the judgment’s finality; if the judgment is reversed, the new trial must proceed unless the appellate court orders otherwise. If the motion for a new trial is conditionally denied, the appellee may assert error in that denial; if the judgment is reversed, the case must proceed as the appellate court orders.

(d) TIME FOR A LOSING PARTY’S NEW-TRIAL MOTION. Any motion for a new trial under Rule 59 by a party against whom judgment as a matter of law is rendered must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.

(e) DENYING THE MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW; REVERSAL ON APPEAL. If the court denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the prevailing party may, as appellee, assert grounds entitling it to a new trial should the appellate court con- clude that the trial court erred in denying the motion. If the ap- pellate court reverses the judgment, it may order a new trial, di- rect the trial court to determine whether a new trial should be granted, or direct the entry of judgment. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Dec. 1, 1991; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 27, 1995, eff. Dec. 1, 1995; Apr. 12, 2006, eff. Dec. 1, 2006; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)

# Rule 51. Instructions to the Jury; Objections; Preserving a Claim

# of Error

# (a) REQUESTS.

(1) Before or at the Close of the Evidence. At the close of the evidence or at any earlier reasonable time that the court or- ders, a party may file and furnish to every other party written requests for the jury instructions it wants the court to give. (2) After the Close of the Evidence. After the close of the evi-

# dence, a party may:

(A) file requests for instructions on issues that could not reasonably have been anticipated by an earlier time that the court set for requests; and

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 52

(B) with the court’s permission, file untimely requests

# for instructions on any issue.

# (b) INSTRUCTIONS. The court:

(1) must inform the parties of its proposed instructions and proposed action on the requests before instructing the jury and before final jury arguments;

(2) must give the parties an opportunity to object on the record and out of the jury’s hearing before the instructions and arguments are delivered; and

(3) may instruct the jury at any time before the jury is dis-

charged.

# (c) OBJECTIONS.

(1) How to Make. A party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the ob- jection.

(2) When to Make. An objection is timely if:

(A) a party objects at the opportunity provided under

(B) a party was not informed of an instruction or action on a request before that opportunity to object, and the party objects promptly after learning that the instruction or request will be, or has been, given or refused.

# (d) ASSIGNING ERROR; PLAIN ERROR.

(1) Assigning Error. A party may assign as error:

(A) an error in an instruction actually given, if that

party properly objected; or

(B) a failure to give an instruction, if that party properly requested it and—unless the court rejected the request in a definitive ruling on the record—also properly objected. (2) Plain Error. A court may consider a plain error in the in- structions that has not been preserved as required by Rule 51(d)(1) if the error affects substantial rights.

# Rule 52. Findings and Conclusions by the Court; Judgment on Par-

# tial Findings

# (a) FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS.

(1) In General. In an action tried on the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court must find the facts spe- cially and state its conclusions of law separately. The findings and conclusions may be stated on the record after the close of the evidence or may appear in an opinion or a memorandum of decision filed by the court. Judgment must be entered under Rule 58.

(2) For an Interlocutory Injunction. In granting or refusing an interlocutory injunction, the court must similarly state the findings and conclusions that support its action.

(3) For a Motion. The court is not required to state findings or conclusions when ruling on a motion under Rule 12 or 56 or, unless these rules provide otherwise, on any other motion.

(4) Effect of a Master’s Findings. A master’s findings, to the extent adopted by the court, must be considered the court’s findings.

# Rule 53

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(5) Questioning the Evidentiary Support. A party may later question the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the find- ings, whether or not the party requested findings, objected to them, moved to amend them, or moved for partial findings.

(6) Setting Aside the Findings. Findings of fact, whether based on oral or other evidence, must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court must give due regard to the trial court’s opportunity to judge the witnesses’ credibil- ity.

(b) AMENDED OR ADDITIONAL FINDINGS. On a party’s motion filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the court may amend its findings—or make additional findings—and may amend the judgment accordingly. The motion may accompany a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.

(c) JUDGMENT ON PARTIAL FINDINGS. If a party has been fully heard on an issue during a nonjury trial and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment against the party on a claim or defense that, under the controlling law, can be maintained or defeated only with a favorable finding on that issue. The court may, however, decline to render any judg- ment until the close of the evidence. A judgment on partial find- ings must be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Rule 52(a).

# Rule 53. Masters

# (a) APPOINTMENT.

(1) Scope. Unless a statute provides otherwise, a court may

# appoint a master only to:

(A) perform duties consented to by the parties; (B) hold trial proceedings and make or recommend find- ings of fact on issues to be decided without a jury if ap- pointment is warranted by:

(i) some exceptional condition; or (ii) the need to perform an accounting or resolve a

# difficult computation of damages; or

(C) address pretrial and posttrial matters that cannot be effectively and timely addressed by an available district judge or magistrate judge of the district.

(2) Disqualification. A master must not have a relationship to the parties, attorneys, action, or court that would require dis- qualification of a judge under 28 U.S.C. § 455, unless the par- ties, with the court’s approval, consent to the appointment after the master discloses any potential grounds for disquali- fication.

(3) Possible Expense or Delay. In appointing a master, the court must consider the fairness of imposing the likely ex- penses on the parties and must protect against unreasonable expense or delay.

# (b) ORDER APPOINTING A MASTER.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 53

(1) Notice. Before appointing a master, the court must give the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard. Any party may suggest candidates for appointment.

(2) Contents. The appointing order must direct the master to

# proceed with all reasonable diligence and must state:

(A) the master’s duties, including any investigation or enforcement duties, and any limits on the master’s au- thority under Rule 53(c);

# (B) the circumstances, if any, in which the master may

communicate ex parte with the court or a party;

(C) the nature of the materials to be preserved and filed

# as the record of the master’s activities;

(D) the time limits, method of filing the record, other procedures, and standards for reviewing the master’s or- ders, findings, and recommendations; and

(E) the basis, terms, and procedure for fixing the mas-

# ter’s compensation under Rule 53(g).

(3) Issuing. The court may issue the order only after:

(A) the master files an affidavit disclosing whether there is any ground for disqualification under 28 U.S.C. § 455; and (B) if a ground is disclosed, the parties, with the court’s

approval, waive the disqualification.

(4) Amending. The order may be amended at any time after

notice to the parties and an opportunity to be heard.

# (c) MASTER’S AUTHORITY.

(1) In General. Unless the appointing order directs otherwise,

# a master may:

(A) regulate all proceedings; (B) take all appropriate measures to perform the as-

signed duties fairly and efficiently; and

(C) if conducting an evidentiary hearing, exercise the ap- pointing court’s power to compel, take, and record evi- dence.

(2) Sanctions. The master may by order impose on a party any noncontempt sanction provided by Rule 37 or 45, and may recommend a contempt sanction against a party and sanctions against a nonparty.

(d) MASTER’S ORDERS. A master who issues an order must file it and promptly serve a copy on each party. The clerk must enter the order on the docket.

(e) MASTER’S REPORTS. A master must report to the court as re- quired by the appointing order. The master must file the report and promptly serve a copy on each party, unless the court orders otherwise.

# (f) ACTION ON THE MASTER’S ORDER, REPORT, OR RECOMMENDA-

(1) Opportunity for a Hearing; Action in General. In acting on a master’s order, report, or recommendations, the court must give the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard; may receive evidence; and may adopt or affirm, modify, wholly or partly reject or reverse, or resubmit to the master with in- structions.

(2) Time to Object or Move to Adopt or Modify. A party may file objections to—or a motion to adopt or modify—the master’s order, report, or recommendations no later than 21 days after a copy is served, unless the court sets a different time.

# Rule 54

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(3) Reviewing Factual Findings. The court must decide de novo all objections to findings of fact made or recommended by a master, unless the parties, with the court’s approval, stipulate that:

(A) the findings will be reviewed for clear error; or (B) the findings of a master appointed under Rule

53(a)(1)(A) or (C) will be final.

(4) Reviewing Legal Conclusions. The court must decide de novo all objections to conclusions of law made or rec- ommended by a master.

(5) Reviewing Procedural Matters. Unless the appointing order establishes a different standard of review, the court may set aside a master’s ruling on a procedural matter only for an abuse of discretion.

# (g) COMPENSATION.

(1) Fixing Compensation. Before or after judgment, the court must fix the master’s compensation on the basis and terms stated in the appointing order, but the court may set a new basis and terms after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard.

(2) Payment. The compensation must be paid either:

# the court’s control.

(3) Allocating Payment. The court must allocate payment among the parties after considering the nature and amount of the controversy, the parties’ means, and the extent to which any party is more responsible than other parties for the ref- erence to a master. An interim allocation may be amended to reflect a decision on the merits.

(h) APPOINTING A MAGISTRATE JUDGE. A magistrate judge is sub- ject to this rule only when the order referring a matter to the magistrate judge states that the reference is made under this rule.

# TITLE VII. JUDGMENT

# Rule 54. Judgment; Costs

(a) DEFINITION; FORM. ‘‘Judgment’’ as used in these rules in- cludes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judg- ment should not include recitals of pleadings, a master’s report, or a record of prior proceedings.

(b) JUDGMENT ON MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR INVOLVING MULTIPLE PAR- TIES. When an action presents more than one claim for relief— whether as a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim—or when multiple parties are involved, the court may di- rect entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay. Otherwise, any order or other de- cision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 54

does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties’ rights and liabilities.

(c) DEMAND FOR JUDGMENT; RELIEF TO BE GRANTED. A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings. Every other final judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.

# (d) COSTS; ATTORNEY’S FEES.

(1) Costs Other Than Attorney’s Fees. Unless a federal statute, these rules, or a court order provides otherwise, costs—other than attorney’s fees—should be allowed to the prevailing party. But costs against the United States, its officers, and its agencies may be imposed only to the extent allowed by law. The clerk may tax costs on 14 days’ notice. On motion served within the next 7 days, the court may review the clerk’s ac- tion.

# (2) Attorney’s Fees.

(A) Claim to Be by Motion. A claim for attorney’s fees and related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion un- less the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages.

(B) Timing and Contents of the Motion. Unless a statute or

a court order provides otherwise, the motion must:

(i) be filed no later than 14 days after the entry of

# judgment;

(ii) specify the judgment and the statute, rule, or

other grounds entitling the movant to the award;

(iii) state the amount sought or provide a fair esti-

# mate of it; and

(iv) disclose, if the court so orders, the terms of any agreement about fees for the services for which the claim is made.

(C) Proceedings. Subject to Rule 23(h), the court must, on a party’s request, give an opportunity for adversary sub- missions on the motion in accordance with Rule 43(c) or 78. The court may decide issues of liability for fees before re- ceiving submissions on the value of services. The court must find the facts and state its conclusions of law as pro- vided in Rule 52(a).

(D) Special Procedures by Local Rule; Reference to a Master or a Magistrate Judge. By local rule, the court may estab- lish special procedures to resolve fee-related issues with- out extensive evidentiary hearings. Also, the court may refer issues concerning the value of services to a special master under Rule 53 without regard to the limitations of Rule 53(a)(1), and may refer a motion for attorney’s fees to a magistrate judge under Rule 72(b) as if it were a disposi- tive pretrial matter.

(E) Exceptions. Subparagraphs (A)–(D) do not apply to claims for fees and expenses as sanctions for violating these rules or as sanctions under 28 U.S.C. § 1927.

# Rule 55

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 55. Default; Default Judgment

(a) ENTERING A DEFAULT. When a party against whom a judg- ment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or other- wise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk must enter the party’s default. (b) ENTERING A DEFAULT JUDGMENT.

(1) By the Clerk. If the plaintiff’s claim is for a sum certain or a sum that can be made certain by computation, the clerk— on the plaintiff’s request, with an affidavit showing the amount due—must enter judgment for that amount and costs against a defendant who has been defaulted for not appearing and who is neither a minor nor an incompetent person.

(2) By the Court. In all other cases, the party must apply to the court for a default judgment. A default judgment may be entered against a minor or incompetent person only if rep- resented by a general guardian, conservator, or other like fi- duciary who has appeared. If the party against whom a default judgment is sought has appeared personally or by a represent- ative, that party or its representative must be served with written notice of the application at least 7 days before the hearing. The court may conduct hearings or make referrals— preserving any federal statutory right to a jury trial—when, to enter or effectuate judgment, it needs to:

(A) conduct an accounting; (B) determine the amount of damages; (C) establish the truth of any allegation by evidence; or (D) investigate any other matter.

(c) SETTING ASIDE A DEFAULT OR A DEFAULT JUDGMENT. The court may set aside an entry of default for good cause, and it may set aside a final default judgment under Rule 60(b).

(d) JUDGMENT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. A default judgment may be entered against the United States, its officers, or its agen- cies only if the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence that satisfies the court.

# Rule 56. Summary Judgment

(a) MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDG- MENT. A party may move for summary judgment, identifying each claim or defense—or the part of each claim or defense—on which summary judgment is sought. The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court should state on the record the reasons for granting or denying the motion.

(b) TIME TO FILE A MOTION. Unless a different time is set by local rule or the court orders otherwise, a party may file a motion for summary judgment at any time until 30 days after the close of all discovery.

# (c) PROCEDURES.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 56

(1) Supporting Factual Positions. A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by:

(A) citing to particular parts of materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored in- formation, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (includ- ing those made for purposes of the motion only), admis- sions, interrogatory answers, or other materials; or

(B) showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an ad- verse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.

(2) Objection That a Fact Is Not Supported by Admissible Evi- dence. A party may object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.

(3) Materials Not Cited. The court need consider only the cited materials, but it may consider other materials in the record. (4) Affidavits or Declarations. An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.

(d) WHEN FACTS ARE UNAVAILABLE TO THE NONMOVANT. If a non- movant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified rea- sons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may:

(1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take

# discovery; or

# (3) issue any other appropriate order.

(e) FAILING TO PROPERLY SUPPORT OR ADDRESS A FACT. If a party fails to properly support an assertion of fact or fails to properly address another party’s assertion of fact as required by Rule 56(c), the court may:

(1) give an opportunity to properly support or address the

# fact;

(2) consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion; (3) grant summary judgment if the motion and supporting materials—including the facts considered undisputed—show that the movant is entitled to it; or

# (4) issue any other appropriate order.

(f) JUDGMENT INDEPENDENT OF THE MOTION. After giving notice

and a reasonable time to respond, the court may:

(1) grant summary judgment for a nonmovant; (2) grant the motion on grounds not raised by a party; or (3) consider summary judgment on its own after identifying for the parties material facts that may not be genuinely in dispute.

(g) FAILING TO GRANT ALL THE REQUESTED RELIEF. If the court does not grant all the relief requested by the motion, it may enter an order stating any material fact—including an item of damages or other relief—that is not genuinely in dispute and treating the fact as established in the case.

(h) AFFIDAVIT OR DECLARATION SUBMITTED IN BAD FAITH. If sat- isfied that an affidavit or declaration under this rule is submitted

# Rule 57

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

in bad faith or solely for delay, the court—after notice and a rea- sonable time to respond—may order the submitting party to pay the other party the reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees, it incurred as a result. An offending party or attorney may also be held in contempt or subjected to other appropriate sanctions. (As amended Dec. 27, 1946, eff. Mar. 19, 1948; Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009; Apr. 28, 2010, eff. Dec. 1, 2010.)

# Rule 57. Declaratory Judgment

These rules govern the procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. § 2201. Rules 38 and 39 govern a demand for a jury trial. The existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appro- priate. The court may order a speedy hearing of a declaratory- judgment action. (As amended Dec. 29, 1948, eff. Oct. 20, 1949; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 58. Entering Judgment

(a) SEPARATE DOCUMENT. Every judgment and amended judg- ment must be set out in a separate document, but a separate docu- ment is not required for an order disposing of a motion:

(1) for judgment under Rule 50(b); (2) to amend or make additional findings under Rule 52(b); (3) for attorney’s fees under Rule 54; (4) for a new trial, or to alter or amend the judgment, under

# Rule 59; or

# (5) for relief under Rule 60.

# (b) ENTERING JUDGMENT.

(1) Without the Court’s Direction. Subject to Rule 54(b) and un- less the court orders otherwise, the clerk must, without await- ing the court’s direction, promptly prepare, sign, and enter the judgment when:

(A) the jury returns a general verdict; (B) the court awards only costs or a sum certain; or (C) the court denies all relief.

(2) Court’s Approval Required. Subject to Rule 54(b), the court must promptly approve the form of the judgment, which the clerk must promptly enter, when:

(A) the jury returns a special verdict or a general verdict

with answers to written questions; or

(B) the court grants other relief not described in this

# subdivision (b).

(c) TIME OF ENTRY. For purposes of these rules, judgment is en-

tered at the following times:

(1) if a separate document is not required, when the judg-

ment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a); or

(2) if a separate document is required, when the judgment is entered in the civil docket under Rule 79(a) and the earlier of these events occurs:

(A) it is set out in a separate document; or (B) 150 days have run from the entry in the civil docket. (d) REQUEST FOR ENTRY. A party may request that judgment be

set out in a separate document as required by Rule 58(a).

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 60

(e) COST OR FEE AWARDS. Ordinarily, the entry of judgment may not be delayed, nor the time for appeal extended, in order to tax costs or award fees. But if a timely motion for attorney’s fees is made under Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of ap- peal has been filed and become effective to order that the motion have the same effect under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4) as a timely motion under Rule 59.

# Rule 59. New Trial; Altering or Amending a Judgment

# (a) IN GENERAL.

(1) Grounds for New Trial. The court may, on motion, grant a new trial on all or some of the issues—and to any party—as follows:

(A) after a jury trial, for any reason for which a new trial has heretofore been granted in an action at law in federal court; or

(B) after a nonjury trial, for any reason for which a re- hearing has heretofore been granted in a suit in equity in federal court.

(2) Further Action After a Nonjury Trial. After a nonjury trial, the court may, on motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and direct the entry of a new judgment.

(b) TIME TO FILE A MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL. A motion for a new trial must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of judg- ment.

(c) TIME TO SERVE AFFIDAVITS. When a motion for a new trial is based on affidavits, they must be filed with the motion. The op- posing party has 14 days after being served to file opposing affida- vits. The court may permit reply affidavits.

(d) NEW TRIAL ON THE COURT’S INITIATIVE OR FOR REASONS NOT IN THE MOTION. No later than 28 days after the entry of judgment, the court, on its own, may order a new trial for any reason that would justify granting one on a party’s motion. After giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard, the court may grant a timely motion for a new trial for a reason not stated in the motion. In either event, the court must specify the reasons in its order.

(e) MOTION TO ALTER OR AMEND A JUDGMENT. A motion to alter or amend a judgment must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.

# Rule 60. Relief from a Judgment or Order

(a) CORRECTIONS BASED ON CLERICAL MISTAKES; OVERSIGHTS AND OMISSIONS. The court may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record. The court may do so

# Rule 61

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

on motion or on its own, with or without notice. But after an ap- peal has been docketed in the appellate court and while it is pend- ing, such a mistake may be corrected only with the appellate court’s leave.

(b) GROUNDS FOR RELIEF FROM A FINAL JUDGMENT, ORDER, OR PROCEEDING. On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:

(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence that, with reasonable dili- gence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);

(3) fraud (whether previously called intrinsic or extrinsic),

misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party;

(4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated; or applying it prospectively is no longer equitable; or

(6) any other reason that justifies relief.

# (c) TIMING AND EFFECT OF THE MOTION.

(1) Timing. A motion under Rule 60(b) must be made within a reasonable time—and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) no more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.

(2) Effect on Finality. The motion does not affect the judg-

ment’s finality or suspend its operation.

(d) OTHER POWERS TO GRANT RELIEF. This rule does not limit a

court’s power to:

(1) entertain an independent action to relieve a party from

# a judgment, order, or proceeding;

(2) grant relief under 28 U.S.C. § 1655 to a defendant who was

not personally notified of the action; or

(3) set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.

(e) BILLS AND WRITS ABOLISHED. The following are abolished: bills of review, bills in the nature of bills of review, and writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, and audita querela.

# Rule 61. Harmless Error

Unless justice requires otherwise, no error in admitting or ex- cluding evidence—or any other error by the court or a party—is ground for granting a new trial, for setting aside a verdict, or for vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order. At every stage of the proceeding, the court must disregard all er- rors and defects that do not affect any party’s substantial rights.

# Rule 62. Stay of Proceedings to Enforce a Judgment

(a) AUTOMATIC STAY. Except as provided in Rule 62(c) and (d), execution on a judgment and proceedings to enforce it are stayed for 30 days after its entry, unless the court orders otherwise.

(b) STAY BY BOND OR OTHER SECURITY. At any time after judg- ment is entered, a party may obtain a stay by providing a bond

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 62.1

or other security. The stay takes effect when the court approves the bond or other security and remains in effect for the time spec- ified in the bond or other security.

(c) STAY OF AN INJUNCTION, RECEIVERSHIP, OR PATENT ACCOUNT- ING ORDER. Unless the court orders otherwise, the following are not stayed after being entered, even if an appeal is taken:

# (1) an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an in-

# junction or receivership; or

(2) a judgment or order that directs an accounting in an ac-

# tion for patent infringement.

(d) INJUNCTION PENDING AN APPEAL. While an appeal is pending from an interlocutory order or final judgment that grants, con- tinues, modifies, refuses, dissolves, or refuses to dissolve or mod- ify an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction on terms for bond or other terms that secure the op- posing party’s rights. If the judgment appealed from is rendered by a statutory three-judge district court, the order must be made either:

(1) by that court sitting in open session; or (2) by the assent of all its judges, as evidenced by their sig-

# natures.

(e) STAY WITHOUT BOND ON AN APPEAL BY THE UNITED STATES, ITS OFFICERS, OR ITS AGENCIES. The court must not require a bond, obligation, or other security from the appellant when granting a stay on an appeal by the United States, its officers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed by a department of the federal govern- ment.

(f) STAY IN FAVOR OF A JUDGMENT DEBTOR UNDER STATE LAW. If a judgment is a lien on the judgment debtor’s property under the law of the state where the court is located, the judgment debtor is entitled to the same stay of execution the state court would give.

(g) APPELLATE COURT’S POWER NOT LIMITED. This rule does not limit the power of the appellate court or one of its judges or jus- tices:

(1) to stay proceedings—or suspend, modify, restore, or grant

an injunction—while an appeal is pending; or

(2) to issue an order to preserve the status quo or the effec-

tiveness of the judgment to be entered.

(h) STAY WITH MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR PARTIES. A court may stay the enforcement of a final judgment entered under Rule 54(b) until it enters a later judgment or judgments, and may prescribe terms necessary to secure the benefit of the stayed judgment for the party in whose favor it was entered.

# Rule 62.1. Indicative Ruling on a Motion for Relief That is Barred

by a Pending Appeal

(a) RELIEF PENDING APPEAL. If a timely motion is made for relief that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending, the court may:

# Rule 63

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(1) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

(b) NOTICE TO THE COURT OF APPEALS. The movant must prompt- ly notify the circuit clerk under Federal Rule of Appellate Proce- dure 12.1 if the district court states that it would grant the mo- tion or that the motion raises a substantial issue.

(c) REMAND. The district court may decide the motion if the

# court of appeals remands for that purpose.

# Rule 63. Judge’s Inability to Proceed

If a judge conducting a hearing or trial is unable to proceed, any other judge may proceed upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties. In a hearing or a nonjury trial, the suc- cessor judge must, at a party’s request, recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify again without undue burden. The successor judge may also recall any other witness.

# TITLE VIII. PROVISIONAL AND FINAL REMEDIES

# Rule 64. Seizing a Person or Property

(a) REMEDIES UNDER STATE LAW—IN GENERAL. At the commence- ment of and throughout an action, every remedy is available that, under the law of the state where the court is located, provides for seizing a person or property to secure satisfaction of the potential judgment. But a federal statute governs to the extent it applies. (b) SPECIFIC KINDS OF REMEDIES. The remedies available under this rule include the following—however designated and regardless of whether state procedure requires an independent action:

# Rule 65. Injunctions and Restraining Orders

# (a) PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.

(1) Notice. The court may issue a preliminary injunction only

# on notice to the adverse party.

(2) Consolidating the Hearing with the Trial on the Merits. Be- fore or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a prelimi- nary injunction, the court may advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing. Even when consolidation is not ordered, evidence that is received on the motion and

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 65

that would be admissible at trial becomes part of the trial record and need not be repeated at trial. But the court must preserve any party’s right to a jury trial.

# (b) TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER.

(1) Issuing Without Notice. The court may issue a temporary restraining order without written or oral notice to the adverse party or its attorney only if:

(A) specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition; and

(B) the movant’s attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.

(2) Contents; Expiration. Every temporary restraining order issued without notice must state the date and hour it was is- sued; describe the injury and state why it is irreparable; state why the order was issued without notice; and be promptly filed in the clerk’s office and entered in the record. The order ex- pires at the time after entry—not to exceed 14 days—that the court sets, unless before that time the court, for good cause, extends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer extension. The reasons for an extension must be en- tered in the record.

(3) Expediting the Preliminary-Injunction Hearing. If the order is issued without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunc- tion must be set for hearing at the earliest possible time, tak- ing precedence over all other matters except hearings on older matters of the same character. At the hearing, the party who obtained the order must proceed with the motion; if the party does not, the court must dissolve the order.

(4) Motion to Dissolve. On 2 days’ notice to the party who ob- tained the order without notice—or on shorter notice set by the court—the adverse party may appear and move to dissolve or modify the order. The court must then hear and decide the motion as promptly as justice requires.

(c) SECURITY. The court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully en- joined or restrained. The United States, its officers, and its agen- cies are not required to give security.

# (d) CONTENTS AND SCOPE OF EVERY INJUNCTION AND RESTRAINING

(1) Contents. Every order granting an injunction and every

restraining order must:

(A) state the reasons why it issued; (B) state its terms specifically; and (C) describe in reasonable detail—and not by referring to the complaint or other document—the act or acts re- strained or required.

(2) Persons Bound. The order binds only the following who re-

# ceive actual notice of it by personal service or otherwise:

(A) the parties; (B) the parties’ officers, agents, servants, employees, and

# attorneys; and

# Rule 65.1

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(C) other persons who are in active concert or participa-

tion with anyone described in Rule 65(d)(2)(A) or (B). (e) OTHER LAWS NOT MODIFIED. These rules do not modify the

# following:

(1) any federal statute relating to temporary restraining or- ders or preliminary injunctions in actions affecting employer and employee;

(2) 28 U.S.C. § 2361, which relates to preliminary injunctions in actions of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader; or (3) 28 U.S.C. § 2284, which relates to actions that must be

heard and decided by a three-judge district court.

(f) COPYRIGHT IMPOUNDMENT. This rule applies to copyright-im-

# Rule 65.1. Proceedings Against a Security Provider

Whenever these rules (including the Supplemental Rules for Ad- miralty or Maritime Claims and Asset Forfeiture Actions) require or allow a party to give security, and security is given with one or more security providers, each provider submits to the court’s jurisdiction and irrevocably appoints the court clerk as its agent for receiving service of any papers that affect its liability on the security. The security provider’s liability may be enforced on mo- tion without an independent action. The motion and any notice that the court orders may be served on the court clerk, who must promptly send a copy of each to every security provider whose ad- dress is known. (As added Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 12, 2006, eff. Dec. 1, 2006; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)

# Rule 66. Receivers

These rules govern an action in which the appointment of a re- ceiver is sought or a receiver sues or is sued. But the practice in administering an estate by a receiver or a similar court-appointed officer must accord with the historical practice in federal courts or with a local rule. An action in which a receiver has been ap- pointed may be dismissed only by court order. (As amended Dec. 27, 1946, eff. Mar. 19, 1948; Dec. 29, 1948, eff. Oct. 20, 1949; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 67. Deposit into Court

(a) DEPOSITING PROPERTY. If any part of the relief sought is a money judgment or the disposition of a sum of money or some other deliverable thing, a party—on notice to every other party and by leave of court—may deposit with the court all or part of the money or thing, whether or not that party claims any of it. The depositing party must deliver to the clerk a copy of the order permitting deposit.

(b) INVESTING AND WITHDRAWING FUNDS. Money paid into court under this rule must be deposited and withdrawn in accordance

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 69

with 28 U.S.C. §§ 2041 and 2042 and any like statute. The money must be deposited in an interest-bearing account or invested in a court-approved, interest-bearing instrument.

# Rule 68. Offer of Judgment

(a) MAKING AN OFFER; JUDGMENT ON AN ACCEPTED OFFER. At least 14 days before the date set for trial, a party defending against a claim may serve on an opposing party an offer to allow judgment on specified terms, with the costs then accrued. If, with- in 14 days after being served, the opposing party serves written no- tice accepting the offer, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance, plus proof of service. The clerk must then enter judgment.

(b) UNACCEPTED OFFER. An unaccepted offer is considered with- drawn, but it does not preclude a later offer. Evidence of an unaccepted offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to deter- mine costs.

(c) OFFER AFTER LIABILITY IS DETERMINED. When one party’s li- ability to another has been determined but the extent of liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the party held liable may make an offer of judgment. It must be served within a reasonable time—but at least 14 days—before the date set for a hearing to determine the extent of liability.

(d) PAYING COSTS AFTER AN UNACCEPTED OFFER. If the judgment that the offeree finally obtains is not more favorable than the unaccepted offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the offer was made.

# Rule 69. Execution

# (a) IN GENERAL.

(1) Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure. A money judgment is enforced by a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise. The procedure on execution—and in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of judgment or execution—must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is lo- cated, but a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.

(2) Obtaining Discovery. In aid of the judgment or execution, the judgment creditor or a successor in interest whose interest appears of record may obtain discovery from any person—in- cluding the judgment debtor—as provided in these rules or by the procedure of the state where the court is located.

(b) AGAINST CERTAIN PUBLIC OFFICERS. When a judgment has been entered against a revenue officer in the circumstances stated in 28 U.S.C. § 2006, or against an officer of Congress in the circum- stances stated in 2 U.S.C. § 118,1 the judgment must be satisfied as those statutes provide.

# Rule 70

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 70. Enforcing a Judgment for a Specific Act

(a) PARTY’S FAILURE TO ACT; ORDERING ANOTHER TO ACT. If a judgment requires a party to convey land, to deliver a deed or other document, or to perform any other specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may order the act to be done—at the disobedient party’s expense—by another person appointed by the court. When done, the act has the same effect as if done by the party.

(b) VESTING TITLE. If the real or personal property is within the district, the court—instead of ordering a conveyance—may enter a judgment divesting any party’s title and vesting it in others. That judgment has the effect of a legally executed conveyance.

(c) OBTAINING A WRIT OF ATTACHMENT OR SEQUESTRATION. On ap- plication by a party entitled to performance of an act, the clerk must issue a writ of attachment or sequestration against the dis- obedient party’s property to compel obedience.

(d) OBTAINING A WRIT OF EXECUTION OR ASSISTANCE. On applica- tion by a party who obtains a judgment or order for possession, the clerk must issue a writ of execution or assistance.

(e) HOLDING IN CONTEMPT. The court may also hold the disobe-

# dient party in contempt.

# Rule 71. Enforcing Relief For or Against a Nonparty

When an order grants relief for a nonparty or may be enforced against a nonparty, the procedure for enforcing the order is the same as for a party.

# TITLE IX. SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS

# Rule 71.1. Condemning Real or Personal Property

(a) APPLICABILITY OF OTHER RULES. These rules govern proceed- ings to condemn real and personal property by eminent domain, except as this rule provides otherwise.

(b) JOINDER OF PROPERTIES. The plaintiff may join separate pieces of property in a single action, no matter whether they are owned by the same persons or sought for the same use.

# (c) COMPLAINT.

(1) Caption. The complaint must contain a caption as pro- vided in Rule 10(a). The plaintiff must, however, name as de- fendants both the property—designated generally by kind, quantity, and location—and at least one owner of some part of or interest in the property.

(2) Contents. The complaint must contain a short and plain

# statement of the following:

(A) the authority for the taking; (B) the uses for which the property is to be taken; (C) a description sufficient to identify the property; (D) the interests to be acquired; and

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 71.1

(E) for each piece of property, a designation of each de- fendant who has been joined as an owner or owner of an in- terest in it.

(3) Parties. When the action commences, the plaintiff need join as defendants only those persons who have or claim an in- terest in the property and whose names are then known. But before any hearing on compensation, the plaintiff must add as defendants all those persons who have or claim an interest and whose names have become known or can be found by a reason- ably diligent search of the records, considering both the prop- erty’s character and value and the interests to be acquired. All others may be made defendants under the designation ‘‘Un- known Owners.’’

(4) Procedure. Notice must be served on all defendants as pro- vided in Rule 71.1(d), whether they were named as defendants when the action commenced or were added later. A defendant may answer as provided in Rule 71.1(e). The court, meanwhile, may order any distribution of a deposit that the facts warrant. (5) Filing; Additional Copies. In addition to filing the com- plaint, the plaintiff must give the clerk at least one copy for the defendants’ use and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant.

# (d) PROCESS.

(1) Delivering Notice to the Clerk. On filing a complaint, the plaintiff must promptly deliver to the clerk joint or several notices directed to the named defendants. When adding de- fendants, the plaintiff must deliver to the clerk additional no- tices directed to the new defendants.

# (2) Contents of the Notice.

(A) Main Contents. Each notice must name the court, the title of the action, and the defendant to whom it is di- rected. It must describe the property sufficiently to iden- tify it, but need not describe any property other than that to be taken from the named defendant. The notice must also state:

(i) that the action is to condemn property; (ii) the interest to be taken; (iii) the authority for the taking; (iv) the uses for which the property is to be taken; (v) that the defendant may serve an answer on the plaintiff’s attorney within 21 days after being served with the notice;

(vi) that the failure to so serve an answer constitutes consent to the taking and to the court’s authority to proceed with the action and fix the compensation; and (vii) that a defendant who does not serve an answer

may file a notice of appearance.

(B) Conclusion. The notice must conclude with the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of the plaintiff’s at- torney and an address within the district in which the ac- tion is brought where the attorney may be served.

# (3) Serving the Notice.

(A) Personal Service. When a defendant whose address is known resides within the United States or a territory sub- ject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the

# Rule 71.1

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

United States, personal service of the notice (without a copy of the complaint) must be made in accordance with Rule 4.

# (B) Service by Publication.

(i) A defendant may be served by publication only when the plaintiff’s attorney files a certificate stating that the attorney believes the defendant cannot be per- sonally served, because after diligent inquiry within the state where the complaint is filed, the defendant’s place of residence is still unknown or, if known, that it is beyond the territorial limits of personal service. Service is then made by publishing the notice—once a week for at least 3 successive weeks—in a newspaper published in the county where the property is located or, if there is no such newspaper, in a newspaper with general circulation where the property is located. Be- fore the last publication, a copy of the notice must also be mailed to every defendant who cannot be per- sonally served but whose place of residence is then known. Unknown owners may be served by publication in the same manner by a notice addressed to ‘‘Un- known Owners.’’

(ii) Service by publication is complete on the date of the last publication. The plaintiff’s attorney must prove publication and mailing by a certificate, attach a printed copy of the published notice, and mark on the copy the newspaper’s name and the dates of publi- cation.

(4) Effect of Delivery and Service. Delivering the notice to the clerk and serving it have the same effect as serving a sum- mons under Rule 4.

(5) Amending the Notice; Proof of Service and Amending the Proof. Rule 4(a)(2) governs amending the notice. Rule 4(l) gov- erns proof of service and amending it.

# (e) APPEARANCE OR ANSWER.

(1) Notice of Appearance. A defendant that has no objection or defense to the taking of its property may serve a notice of ap- pearance designating the property in which it claims an inter- est. The defendant must then be given notice of all later pro- ceedings affecting the defendant.

(2) Answer. A defendant that has an objection or defense to the taking must serve an answer within 21 days after being served with the notice. The answer must:

(A) identify the property in which the defendant claims

# an interest;

# the taking.

(3) Waiver of Other Objections and Defenses; Evidence on Com- pensation. A defendant waives all objections and defenses not stated in its answer. No other pleading or motion asserting an additional objection or defense is allowed. But at the trial on compensation, a defendant—whether or not it has previously appeared or answered—may present evidence on the amount of compensation to be paid and may share in the award.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 71.1

(f) AMENDING PLEADINGS. Without leave of court, the plaintiff may—as often as it wants—amend the complaint at any time be- fore the trial on compensation. But no amendment may be made if it would result in a dismissal inconsistent with Rule 71.1(i)(1) or (2). The plaintiff need not serve a copy of an amendment, but must serve notice of the filing, as provided in Rule 5(b), on every af- fected party who has appeared and, as provided in Rule 71.1(d), on every affected party who has not appeared. In addition, the plain- tiff must give the clerk at least one copy of each amendment for the defendants’ use, and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant. A defendant may appear or answer in the time and manner and with the same effect as provided in Rule 71.1(e).

(g) SUBSTITUTING PARTIES. If a defendant dies, becomes incom- petent, or transfers an interest after being joined, the court may, on motion and notice of hearing, order that the proper party be substituted. Service of the motion and notice on a nonparty must be made as provided in Rule 71.1(d)(3).

# (h) TRIAL OF THE ISSUES.

(1) Issues Other Than Compensation; Compensation. In an ac- tion involving eminent domain under federal law, the court tries all issues, including compensation, except when com- pensation must be determined:

(A) by any tribunal specially constituted by a federal

statute to determine compensation; or

(B) if there is no such tribunal, by a jury when a party demands one within the time to answer or within any addi- tional time the court sets, unless the court appoints a commission.

(2) Appointing a Commission; Commission’s Powers and Report. (A) Reasons for Appointing. If a party has demanded a jury, the court may instead appoint a three-person com- mission to determine compensation because of the char- acter, location, or quantity of the property to be con- demned or for other just reasons.

(B) Alternate Commissioners. The court may appoint up to two additional persons to serve as alternate commis- sioners to hear the case and replace commissioners who, before a decision is filed, the court finds unable or dis- qualified to perform their duties. Once the commission renders its final decision, the court must discharge any al- ternate who has not replaced a commissioner.

(C) Examining the Prospective Commissioners. Before mak- ing its appointments, the court must advise the parties of the identity and qualifications of each prospective com- missioner and alternate, and may permit the parties to ex- amine them. The parties may not suggest appointees, but for good cause may object to a prospective commissioner or alternate.

(D) Commission’s Powers and Report. A commission has the powers of a master under Rule 53(c). Its action and re- port are determined by a majority. Rule 53(d), (e), and (f) apply to its action and report.

# (i) DISMISSAL OF THE ACTION OR A DEFENDANT.

# (1) Dismissing the Action.

# Rule 72

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(A) By the Plaintiff. If no compensation hearing on a piece of property has begun, and if the plaintiff has not ac- quired title or a lesser interest or taken possession, the plaintiff may, without a court order, dismiss the action as to that property by filing a notice of dismissal briefly de- scribing the property.

(B) By Stipulation. Before a judgment is entered vesting the plaintiff with title or a lesser interest in or possession of property, the plaintiff and affected defendants may, without a court order, dismiss the action in whole or in part by filing a stipulation of dismissal. And if the parties so stipulate, the court may vacate a judgment already en- tered.

(C) By Court Order. At any time before compensation has been determined and paid, the court may, after a motion and hearing, dismiss the action as to a piece of property. But if the plaintiff has already taken title, a lesser inter- est, or possession as to any part of it, the court must award compensation for the title, lesser interest, or pos- session taken.

(2) Dismissing a Defendant. The court may at any time dis- miss a defendant who was unnecessarily or improperly joined. (3) Effect. A dismissal is without prejudice unless otherwise

stated in the notice, stipulation, or court order.

# (j) DEPOSIT AND ITS DISTRIBUTION.

(1) Deposit. The plaintiff must deposit with the court any money required by law as a condition to the exercise of emi- nent domain and may make a deposit when allowed by stat- ute.

(2) Distribution; Adjusting Distribution. After a deposit, the court and attorneys must expedite the proceedings so as to distribute the deposit and to determine and pay compensation. If the compensation finally awarded to a defendant exceeds the amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment against the plaintiff for the deficiency. If the compensation awarded to a defendant is less than the amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment against that defendant for the overpayment.

(k) CONDEMNATION UNDER A STATE’S POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN. This rule governs an action involving eminent domain under state law. But if state law provides for trying an issue by jury—or for trying the issue of compensation by jury or commission or both— that law governs.

(l) COSTS. Costs are not subject to Rule 54(d).

# Rule 72. Magistrate Judges: Pretrial Order

(a) NONDISPOSITIVE MATTERS. When a pretrial matter not dis- positive of a party’s claim or defense is referred to a magistrate

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 73

judge to hear and decide, the magistrate judge must promptly conduct the required proceedings and, when appropriate, issue a written order stating the decision. A party may serve and file ob- jections to the order within 14 days after being served with a copy. A party may not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to. The district judge in the case must consider timely objections and modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.

# (b) DISPOSITIVE MOTIONS AND PRISONER PETITIONS.

(1) Findings and Recommendations. A magistrate judge must promptly conduct the required proceedings when assigned, without the parties’ consent, to hear a pretrial matter disposi- tive of a claim or defense or a prisoner petition challenging the conditions of confinement. A record must be made of all evidentiary proceedings and may, at the magistrate judge’s discretion, be made of any other proceedings. The magistrate judge must enter a recommended disposition, including, if ap- propriate, proposed findings of fact. The clerk must promptly mail a copy to each party.

(2) Objections. Within 14 days after being served with a copy of the recommended disposition, a party may serve and file specific written objections to the proposed findings and recom- mendations. A party may respond to another party’s objec- tions within 14 days after being served with a copy. Unless the district judge orders otherwise, the objecting party must promptly arrange for transcribing the record, or whatever por- tions of it the parties agree to or the magistrate judge consid- ers sufficient.

(3) Resolving Objections. The district judge must determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge’s disposition that has been properly objected to. The district judge may accept, re- ject, or modify the recommended disposition; receive further evidence; or return the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.

# Rule 73. Magistrate Judges: Trial by Consent; Appeal

(a) TRIAL BY CONSENT. When authorized under 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), a magistrate judge may, if all parties consent, conduct a civil ac- tion or proceeding, including a jury or nonjury trial. A record must be made in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(5).

# (b) CONSENT PROCEDURE.

(1) In General. When a magistrate judge has been designated to conduct civil actions or proceedings, the clerk must give the parties written notice of their opportunity to consent under 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). To signify their consent, the parties must jointly or separately file a statement consenting to the referral. A district judge or magistrate judge may be informed of a party’s response to the clerk’s notice only if all parties have consented to the referral.

# Rule 74

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(2) Reminding the Parties About Consenting. A district judge, magistrate judge, or other court official may remind the par- ties of the magistrate judge’s availability, but must also ad- vise them that they are free to withhold consent without ad- verse substantive consequences.

(c) APPEALING A JUDGMENT. In accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(3), an appeal from a judgment entered at a magistrate judge’s direction may be taken to the court of appeals as would any other appeal from a district-court judgment. (As added Apr. 28, 1983, eff. Aug. 1, 1983; amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Aug. 1, 1987; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# TITLE XI. GENERAL PROVISIONS

# Rule 81. Applicability of the Rules in General; Removed Actions

# (a) APPLICABILITY TO PARTICULAR PROCEEDINGS.

(1) Prize Proceedings. These rules do not apply to prize pro-

ceedings in admiralty governed by 10 U.S.C. §§ 7651–7681.

(2) Bankruptcy. These rules apply to bankruptcy proceedings to the extent provided by the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.

(3) Citizenship. These rules apply to proceedings for admis- sion to citizenship to the extent that the practice in those pro- ceedings is not specified in federal statutes and has previously conformed to the practice in civil actions. The provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1451 for service by publication and for answer apply in proceedings to cancel citizenship certificates.

(4) Special Writs. These rules apply to proceedings for habeas corpus and for quo warranto to the extent that the practice in those proceedings:

(A) is not specified in a federal statute, the Rules Gov- erning Section 2254 Cases, or the Rules Governing Section 2255 Cases; and

(B) has previously conformed to the practice in civil ac-

# tions.

(5) Proceedings Involving a Subpoena. These rules apply to proceedings to compel testimony or the production of docu- ments through a subpoena issued by a United States officer or agency under a federal statute, except as otherwise provided by statute, by local rule, or by court order in the proceedings. (6) Other Proceedings. These rules, to the extent applicable, govern proceedings under the following laws, except as these laws provide other procedures:

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 81

(A) 7 U.S.C. §§ 292, 499g(c), for reviewing an order of the

# Secretary of Agriculture;

(B) 9 U.S.C., relating to arbitration; (C) 15 U.S.C. § 522, for reviewing an order of the Secretary

# of the Interior;

(D) 15 U.S.C. § 715d(c), for reviewing an order denying a

# certificate of clearance;

(E) 29 U.S.C. §§ 159, 160, for enforcing an order of the Na-

# tional Labor Relations Board;

(F) 33 U.S.C. §§ 918, 921, for enforcing or reviewing a com- pensation order under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act; and

(G) 45 U.S.C. § 159, for reviewing an arbitration award in

# a railway-labor dispute.

(b) SCIRE FACIAS AND MANDAMUS. The writs of scire facias and mandamus are abolished. Relief previously available through them may be obtained by appropriate action or motion under these rules.

# (c) REMOVED ACTIONS.

(1) Applicability. These rules apply to a civil action after it

is removed from a state court.

(2) Further Pleading. After removal, repleading is unneces- sary unless the court orders it. A defendant who did not an- swer before removal must answer or present other defenses or objections under these rules within the longest of these peri- ods:

(A) 21 days after receiving—through service or other- wise—a copy of the initial pleading stating the claim for relief;

(B) 21 days after being served with the summons for an

initial pleading on file at the time of service; or (C) 7 days after the notice of removal is filed.

# (3) Demand for a Jury Trial.

(A) As Affected by State Law. A party who, before re- moval, expressly demanded a jury trial in accordance with state law need not renew the demand after removal. If the state law did not require an express demand for a jury trial, a party need not make one after removal unless the court orders the parties to do so within a specified time. The court must so order at a party’s request and may so order on its own. A party who fails to make a demand when so ordered waives a jury trial.

(B) Under Rule 38. If all necessary pleadings have been served at the time of removal, a party entitled to a jury trial under Rule 38 must be given one if the party serves a demand within 14 days after:

(i) it files a notice of removal; or (ii) it is served with a notice of removal filed by an-

# other party.

# (d) LAW APPLICABLE.

(1) ‘‘State Law’’ Defined. When these rules refer to state law, the term ‘‘law’’ includes the state’s statutes and the state’s ju- dicial decisions.

(2) ‘‘State’’ Defined. The term ‘‘state’’ includes, where appro- priate, the District of Columbia and any United States com- monwealth or territory.

# Rule 82

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

(3) ‘‘Federal Statute’’ Defined in the District of Columbia. In the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, the term ‘‘federal statute’’ includes any Act of Congress that ap- plies locally to the District.

# Rule 82. Jurisdiction and Venue Unaffected

These rules do not extend or limit the jurisdiction of the district courts or the venue of actions in those courts. An admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h) is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1390. (As amended Dec. 29, 1948, eff. Oct. 20, 1949; Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; Apr. 23, 2001, eff. Dec. 1, 2001; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Apr. 28, 2016, eff. Dec. 1, 2016.)

# Rule 83. Rules by District Courts; Judge’s Directives

# (a) LOCAL RULES.

(1) In General. After giving public notice and an opportunity for comment, a district court, acting by a majority of its dis- trict judges, may adopt and amend rules governing its prac- tice. A local rule must be consistent with—but not duplicate— federal statutes and rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2072 and 2075, and must conform to any uniform numbering system pre- scribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States. A local rule takes effect on the date specified by the district court and remains in effect unless amended by the court or ab- rogated by the judicial council of the circuit. Copies of rules and amendments must, on their adoption, be furnished to the judicial council and the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and be made available to the public.

(2) Requirement of Form. A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a way that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure to comply.

(b) PROCEDURE WHEN THERE IS NO CONTROLLING LAW. A judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law, rules adopted under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2072 and 2075, and the district’s local rules. No sanction or other disadvantage may be imposed for noncompliance with any requirement not in federal law, federal rules, or the local rules unless the alleged violator has been fur- nished in the particular case with actual notice of the require- ment. (As amended Apr. 29, 1985, eff. Aug. 1, 1985; Apr. 27, 1995, eff. Dec. 1, 1995; Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# Rule 85. Title

These rules may be cited as the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-

dure. (As amended Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007.)

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 86

# Rule 86. Effective Dates

(a) IN GENERAL. These rules and any amendments take effect at the time specified by the Supreme Court, subject to 28 U.S.C. § 2074. They govern:

(1) proceedings in an action commenced after their effective

# date; and

(2) proceedings after that date in an action then pending un-

# less:

(A) the Supreme Court specifies otherwise; or (B) the court determines that applying them in a par-

ticular action would be infeasible or work an injustice. (b) DECEMBER 1, 2007 AMENDMENTS. If any provision in Rules 1–5.1, 6–73, or 77–86 conflicts with another law, priority in time for the purpose of 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b) is not affected by the amend- ments taking effect on December 1, 2007.

(a) By Garnishee. The garnishee shall serve an answer, to- gether with answers to any interrogatories served with the complaint, within 21 days after service of process upon the garnishee. Interrogatories to the garnishee may be served with the complaint without leave of court. If the garnishee refuses or neglects to answer on oath as to the debts, credits, or ef- fects of the defendant in the garnishee’s hands, or any inter- rogatories concerning such debts, credits, and effects that may be propounded by the plaintiff, the court may award compul- sory process against the garnishee.

within the district while the action is pending.

# (a) Arrest Warrant.

(i) The court must review the complaint and any sup- porting papers. If the conditions for an in rem action ap- pear to exist, the court must issue an order directing the clerk to issue a warrant for the arrest of the vessel or other property that is the subject of the action.

(ii) If the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney certifies that exigent circumstances make court review impractica- ble, the clerk must promptly issue a summons and a war- rant for the arrest of the vessel or other property that is the subject of the action.

(5) ANCILLARY PROCESS. In any action in rem in which process has been served as provided by this rule, if any part of the prop- erty that is the subject of the action has not been brought within the control of the court because it has been removed or sold, or because it is intangible property in the hands of a person who has not been served with process, the court may, on motion, order any person having possession or control of such property or its pro- ceeds to show cause why it should not be delivered into the cus- tody of the marshal or other person or organization having a war- rant for the arrest of the property, or paid into court to abide the judgment; and, after hearing, the court may enter such judgment as law and justice may require.

(a) Complaint. In actions to which this rule is applicable the complaint shall state the circumstances from which the claim arises with such particularity that the defendant or claimant will be able, without moving for a more definite statement, to commence an investigation of the facts and to frame a respon- sive pleading.

(b) Security for Costs. Subject to the provisions of Rule 54(d) and of relevant statutes, the court may, on the filing of the complaint or on the appearance of any defendant, claimant, or any other party, or at any later time, require the plaintiff, de- fendant, claimant, or other party to give security, or addi- tional security, in such sum as the court shall direct to pay all costs and expenses that shall be awarded against the party by any interlocutory order or by the final judgment, or on ap- peal by any appellate court.

(a) In admiralty and maritime proceedings process in rem or of maritime attachment and garnishment may be served only within the district.

(b) Issuance and Delivery. Issuance and delivery of process in rem, or of maritime attachment and garnishment, shall be held in abeyance if the plaintiff so requests.

# (4) EXECUTION OF PROCESS; MARSHAL’S RETURN; CUSTODY OF

(a) In General. Upon issuance and delivery of the process, or, in the case of summons with process of attachment and gar- nishment, when it appears that the defendant cannot be found within the district, the marshal or other person or organiza- tion having a warrant shall forthwith execute the process in accordance with this subdivision (4), making due and prompt return.

(b) Tangible Property. If tangible property is to be attached or arrested, the marshal or other person or organization hav- ing the warrant shall take it into the marshal’s possession for safe custody. If the character or situation of the property is such that the taking of actual possession is impracticable, the marshal or other person executing the process shall affix a copy thereof to the property in a conspicuous place and leave a copy of the complaint and process with the person having possession or the person’s agent. In furtherance of the mar- shal’s custody of any vessel the marshal is authorized to make a written request to the collector of customs not to grant clearance to such vessel until notified by the marshal or dep- uty marshal or by the clerk that the vessel has been released in accordance with these rules.

(c) Intangible Property. If intangible property is to be at- tached or arrested the marshal or other person or organization having the warrant shall execute the process by leaving with

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule E

the garnishee or other obligor a copy of the complaint and process requiring the garnishee or other obligor to answer as provided in Rules B(3)(a) and C(6); or the marshal may accept for payment into the registry of the court the amount owed to the extent of the amount claimed by the plaintiff with inter- est and costs, in which event the garnishee or other obligor shall not be required to answer unless alias process shall be served.

(d) Directions With Respect to Property in Custody. The mar- shal or other person or organization having the warrant may at any time apply to the court for directions with respect to property that has been attached or arrested, and shall give no- tice of such application to any or all of the parties as the court may direct.

(e) Expenses of Seizing and Keeping Property; Deposit. These rules do not alter the provisions of Title 28, U.S.C., § 1921, as amended, relative to the expenses of seizing and keeping prop- erty attached or arrested and to the requirement of deposits to cover such expenses.

(f) Procedure for Release From Arrest or Attachment. Whenever property is arrested or attached, any person claiming an inter- est in it shall be entitled to a prompt hearing at which the plaintiff shall be required to show why the arrest or attach- ment should not be vacated or other relief granted consistent with these rules. This subdivision shall have no application to suits for seamen’s wages when process is issued upon a certifi- cation of sufficient cause filed pursuant to Title 46, U.S.C. §§ 603 and 604 2 or to actions by the United States for forfeitures for violation of any statute of the United States.

(a) Special Bond. Whenever process of maritime attachment and garnishment or process in rem is issued the execution of such process shall be stayed, or the property released, on the giving of security, to be approved by the court or clerk, or by stipulation of the parties, conditioned to answer the judgment of the court or of any appellate court. The parties may stipu- late the amount and nature of such security. In the event of the inability or refusal of the parties so to stipulate the court shall fix the principal sum of the bond or stipulation at an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the plaintiff’s claim fairly stated with accrued interest and costs; but the principal sum shall in no event exceed (i) twice the amount of the plain- tiff’s claim or (ii) the value of the property on due appraise- ment, whichever is smaller. The bond or stipulation shall be conditioned for the payment of the principal sum and interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum.

(b) General Bond. The owner of any vessel may file a general bond or stipulation, with sufficient surety, to be approved by the court, conditioned to answer the judgment of such court in all or any actions that may be brought thereafter in such court in which the vessel is attached or arrested. Thereupon the execution of all such process against such vessel shall be

stayed so long as the amount secured by such bond or stipula- tion is at least double the aggregate amount claimed by plain- tiffs in all actions begun and pending in which such vessel has been attached or arrested. Judgments and remedies may be had on such bond or stipulation as if a special bond or stipula- tion had been filed in each of such actions. The district court may make necessary orders to carry this rule into effect, par- ticularly as to the giving of proper notice of any action against or attachment of a vessel for which a general bond has been filed. Such bond or stipulation shall be indorsed by the clerk with a minute of the actions wherein process is so stayed. Further security may be required by the court at any time.

If a special bond or stipulation is given in a particular case, the liability on the general bond or stipulation shall cease as to that case.

(c) Release by Consent or Stipulation; Order of Court or Clerk; Costs. Any vessel, cargo, or other property in the custody of the marshal or other person or organization having the war- rant may be released forthwith upon the marshal’s acceptance and approval of a stipulation, bond, or other security, signed by the party on whose behalf the property is detained or the party’s attorney and expressly authorizing such release, if all costs and charges of the court and its officers shall have first been paid. Otherwise no property in the custody of the mar- shal, other person or organization having the warrant, or other officer of the court shall be released without an order of the court; but such order may be entered as of course by the clerk, upon the giving of approved security as provided by law and these rules, or upon the dismissal or discontinuance of the action; but the marshal or other person or organization having the warrant shall not deliver any property so released until the costs and charges of the officers of the court shall first have been paid.

(d) Possessory, Petitory, and Partition Actions. The foregoing provisions of this subdivision (5) do not apply to petitory, pos- sessory, and partition actions. In such cases the property ar- rested shall be released only by order of the court, on such terms and conditions and on the giving of such security as the court may require.

(6) REDUCTION OR IMPAIRMENT OF SECURITY. Whenever security is taken the court may, on motion and hearing, for good cause shown, reduce the amount of security given; and if the surety shall be or become insufficient, new or additional sureties may be required on motion and hearing. (7) SECURITY ON COUNTERCLAIM.

(a) When a person who has given security for damages in the original action asserts a counterclaim that arises from the transaction or occurrence that is the subject of the original action, a plaintiff for whose benefit the security has been given must give security for damages demanded in the coun- terclaim unless the court, for cause shown, directs otherwise. Proceedings on the original claim must be stayed until this se- curity is given, unless the court directs otherwise.

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule F

(b) The plaintiff is required to give security under Rule E(7)(a) when the United States or its corporate instrumental- ity counterclaims and would have been required to give secu- rity to respond in damages if a private party but is relieved by law from giving security.

(8) RESTRICTED APPEARANCE. An appearance to defend against an admiralty and maritime claim with respect to which there has is- sued process in rem, or process of attachment and garnishment, may be expressly restricted to the defense of such claim, and in that event is not an appearance for the purposes of any other claim with respect to which such process is not available or has not been served.

(9) DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY; SALES. (a) Interlocutory Sales; Delivery.

(i) On application of a party, the marshal, or other per- son having custody of the property, the court may order all or part of the property sold—with the sales proceeds, or as much of them as will satisfy the judgment, paid into court to await further orders of the court—if:

(A) the attached or arrested property is perishable, or liable to deterioration, decay, or injury by being de- tained in custody pending the action;

(B) the expense of keeping the property is excessive

# or disproportionate; or

(C) there is an unreasonable delay in securing release

# of the property.

(ii) In the circumstances described in Rule E(9)(a)(i), the court, on motion by a defendant or a person filing a state- ment of interest or right under Rule C(6), may order that the property, rather than being sold, be delivered to the movant upon giving security under these rules.

(b) Sales, Proceeds. All sales of property shall be made by the marshal or a deputy marshal, or by other person or organiza- tion having the warrant, or by any other person assigned by the court where the marshal or other person or organization having the warrant is a party in interest; and the proceeds of sale shall be forthwith paid into the registry of the court to be disposed of according to law.

(10) PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY. When the owner or another per- son remains in possession of property attached or arrested under the provisions of Rule E(4)(b) that permit execution of process without taking actual possession, the court, on a party’s motion or on its own, may enter any order necessary to preserve the prop- erty and to prevent its removal.

# Rule F. Limitation of Liability

(1) TIME FOR FILING COMPLAINT; SECURITY. Not later than six months after receipt of a claim in writing, any vessel owner may file a complaint in the appropriate district court, as provided in subdivision (9) of this rule, for limitation of liability pursuant to statute. The owner (a) shall deposit with the court, for the benefit

# Rule F

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

of claimants, a sum equal to the amount or value of the owner’s interest in the vessel and pending freight, or approved security therefor, and in addition such sums, or approved security therefor, as the court may from time to time fix as necessary to carry out the provisions of the statutes as amended; or (b) at the owner’s op- tion shall transfer to a trustee to be appointed by the court, for the benefit of claimants, the owner’s interest in the vessel and pending freight, together with such sums, or approved security therefor, as the court may from time to time fix as necessary to carry out the provisions of the statutes as amended. The plaintiff shall also give security for costs and, if the plaintiff elects to give security, for interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum from the date of the security.

(2) COMPLAINT. The complaint shall set forth the facts on the basis of which the right to limit liability is asserted and all facts necessary to enable the court to determine the amount to which the owner’s liability shall be limited. The complaint may demand exoneration from as well as limitation of liability. It shall state the voyage if any, on which the demands sought to be limited arose, with the date and place of its termination; the amount of all demands including all unsatisfied liens or claims of lien, in contract or in tort or otherwise, arising on that voyage, so far as known to the plaintiff, and what actions and proceedings, if any, are pending thereon; whether the vessel was damaged, lost, or abandoned, and, if so, when and where; the value of the vessel at the close of the voyage or, in case of wreck, the value of her wreckage, strippings, or proceeds, if any, and where and in whose possession they are; and the amount of any pending freight recov- ered or recoverable. If the plaintiff elects to transfer the plain- tiff’s interest in the vessel to a trustee, the complaint must fur- ther show any prior paramount liens thereon, and what voyages or trips, if any, she has made since the voyage or trip on which the claims sought to be limited arose, and any existing liens arising upon any such subsequent voyage or trip, with the amounts and causes thereof, and the names and addresses of the lienors, so far as known; and whether the vessel sustained any injury upon or by reason of such subsequent voyage or trip.

(3) CLAIMS AGAINST OWNER; INJUNCTION. Upon compliance by the owner with the requirements of subdivision (1) of this rule all claims and proceedings against the owner or the owner’s property with respect to the matter in question shall cease. On application of the plaintiff the court shall enjoin the further prosecution of any action or proceeding against the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s property with respect to any claim subject to limitation in the ac- tion.

(4) NOTICE TO CLAIMANTS. Upon the owner’s compliance with sub- division (1) of this rule the court shall issue a notice to all persons asserting claims with respect to which the complaint seeks limi- tation, admonishing them to file their respective claims with the clerk of the court and to serve on the attorneys for the plaintiff a copy thereof on or before a date to be named in the notice. The date so fixed shall not be less than 30 days after issuance of the notice. For cause shown, the court may enlarge the time within which claims may be filed. The notice shall be published in such newspaper or newspapers as the court may direct once a week for

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule F

four successive weeks prior to the date fixed for the filing of claims. The plaintiff not later than the day of second publication shall also mail a copy of the notice to every person known to have made any claim against the vessel or the plaintiff arising out of the voyage or trip on which the claims sought to be limited arose. In cases involving death a copy of such notice shall be mailed to the decedent at the decedent’s last known address, and also to any person who shall be known to have made any claim on account of such death.

(5) CLAIMS AND ANSWER. Claims shall be filed and served on or before the date specified in the notice provided for in subdivision (4) of this rule. Each claim shall specify the facts upon which the claimant relies in support of the claim, the items thereof, and the dates on which the same accrued. If a claimant desires to contest either the right to exoneration from or the right to limitation of liability the claimant shall file and serve an answer to the com- plaint unless the claim has included an answer.

(6) INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN CLAIMANTS. Within 30 days after the date specified in the notice for filing claims, or within such time as the court thereafter may allow, the plaintiff shall mail to the attorney for each claimant (or if the claimant has no attorney to the claimant) a list setting forth (a) the name of each claimant, (b) the name and address of the claimant’s attorney (if the claim- ant is known to have one), (c) the nature of the claim, i.e., wheth- er property loss, property damage, death, personal injury etc., and (d) the amount thereof.

(7) INSUFFICIENCY OF FUND OR SECURITY. Any claimant may by motion demand that the funds deposited in court or the security given by the plaintiff be increased on the ground that they are less than the value of the plaintiff’s interest in the vessel and pending freight. Thereupon the court shall cause due appraise- ment to be made of the value of the plaintiff’s interest in the ves- sel and pending freight; and if the court finds that the deposit or security is either insufficient or excessive it shall order its in- crease or reduction. In like manner any claimant may demand that the deposit or security be increased on the ground that it is insufficient to carry out the provisions of the statutes relating to claims in respect of loss of life or bodily injury; and, after notice and hearing, the court may similarly order that the deposit or se- curity be increased or reduced.

(8) OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS: DISTRIBUTION OF FUND. Any interested party may question or controvert any claim without filing an ob- jection thereto. Upon determination of liability the fund depos- ited or secured, or the proceeds of the vessel and pending freight, shall be divided pro rata, subject to all relevant provisions of law, among the several claimants in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims, duly proved, saving, however, to all parties any priority to which they may be legally entitled.

(9) VENUE; TRANSFER. The complaint shall be filed in any dis- trict in which the vessel has been attached or arrested to answer for any claim with respect to which the plaintiff seeks to limit li- ability; or, if the vessel has not been attached or arrested, then in any district in which the owner has been sued with respect to any such claim. When the vessel has not been attached or arrested to answer the matters aforesaid, and suit has not been commenced

# Rule G

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

against the owner, the proceedings may be had in the district in which the vessel may be, but if the vessel is not within any dis- trict and no suit has been commenced in any district, then the complaint may be filed in any district. For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, the court may transfer the action to any district; if venue is wrongly laid the court shall dismiss or, if it be in the interest of justice, transfer the action to any district in which it could have been brought. If the vessel shall have been sold, the proceeds shall represent the vessel for the purposes of these rules.

# Rule G. Forfeiture Actions In Rem

# ity;

(B) state the times under Rule G(5) to file a claim

# (7) PRESERVING, PREVENTING CRIMINAL USE, AND DISPOSING OF

(a) Preserving and Preventing Criminal Use of Property.

# (b) Interlocutory Sale or Delivery.

(i) Order to Sell. On motion by a party or a person hav- ing custody of the property, the court may order all or part of the property sold if:

(A) the property is perishable or at risk of deteriora- tion, decay, or injury by being detained in custody pending the action;

(B) the expense of keeping the property is excessive

or is disproportionate to its fair market value;

(C) the property is subject to a mortgage or to taxes

on which the owner is in default; or

(D) the court finds other good cause.

(ii) Who Makes the Sale. A sale must be made by a United States agency that has authority to sell the prop- erty, by the agency’s contractor, or by any person the court designates.

(iii) Sale Procedures. The sale is governed by 28 U.S.C. §§ 2001, 2002, and 2004, unless all parties, with the court’s approval, agree to the sale, aspects of the sale, or different procedures.

(iv) Sale Proceeds. Sale proceeds are a substitute res subject to forfeiture in place of the property that was sold. The proceeds must be held in an interest-bearing account maintained by the United States pending the conclusion of the forfeiture action.

(v) Delivery on a Claimant’s Motion. The court may order that the property be delivered to the claimant pend- ing the conclusion of the action if the claimant shows cir- cumstances that would permit sale under Rule G(7)(b)(i) and gives security under these rules.

(c) Disposing of Forfeited Property. Upon entry of a forfeiture judgment, the property or proceeds from selling the property must be disposed of as provided by law.

(a) Motion To Suppress Use of the Property as Evidence. If the defendant property was seized, a party with standing to con- test the lawfulness of the seizure may move to suppress use of the property as evidence. Suppression does not affect forfeit- ure of the property based on independently derived evidence.

# (b) Motion To Dismiss the Action.

(i) A claimant who establishes standing to contest for- feiture may move to dismiss the action under Rule 12(b). (ii) In an action governed by 18 U.S.C. § 983(a)(3)(D) the complaint may not be dismissed on the ground that the government did not have adequate evidence at the time the complaint was filed to establish the forfeitability of the property. The sufficiency of the complaint is governed by Rule G(2).

# FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

# Rule 1

# (c) Motion To Strike a Claim or Answer.

(i) At any time before trial, the government may move

to strike a claim or answer:

(A) for failing to comply with Rule G(5) or (6), or (B) because the claimant lacks standing.

# (ii) The motion:

(A) must be decided before any motion by the claim-

ant to dismiss the action; and

(B) may be presented as a motion for judgment on the pleadings or as a motion to determine after a hear- ing or by summary judgment whether the claimant can carry the burden of establishing standing by a prepon- derance of the evidence.

# (d) Petition To Release Property.

(i) If a United States agency or an agency’s contractor holds property for judicial or nonjudicial forfeiture under a statute governed by 18 U.S.C. § 983(f), a person who has filed a claim to the property may petition for its release under § 983(f).

(ii) If a petition for release is filed before a judicial for- feiture action is filed against the property, the petition may be filed either in the district where the property was seized or in the district where a warrant to seize the prop- erty issued. If a judicial forfeiture action against the prop- erty is later filed in another district—or if the government shows that the action will be filed in another district—the petition may be transferred to that district under 28 U.S.C. § 1404.

(e) Excessive Fines. A claimant may seek to mitigate a for- feiture under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amend- ment by motion for summary judgment or by motion made after entry of a forfeiture judgment if:

(i) the claimant has pleaded the defense under Rule 8;

# and

(ii) the parties have had the opportunity to conduct civil

# discovery on the defense.

(9) TRIAL. Trial is to the court unless any party demands trial

by jury under Rule 38. (As added Apr. 12, 2006, eff. Dec. 1, 2006; amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009.)
